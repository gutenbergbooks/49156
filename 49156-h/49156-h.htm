<p class='center'><i>SERIAL STORIES AND SERIES OF ARTICLES</i>:</p>


<p class="unindent"><span class="big">The Story of Keedon Bluffs.</span> By <i>Charles Egbert Craddock</i>, author of “The Prophet
of the Great Smoky Mountains,” “Down the Ravine,”
etc. A dramatic serial of boy life in the Great Smokies, with new scenes and new characters, among the latter a jolly
young mountaineer who sings original dialect songs full of wild humor. Illustrations by Edmund H. Garrett.</p>


<p class="unindent"><span class="big">Romulus and Remus.</span> By <i>Charles Remington Talbot</i>. This story is <i>not</i> a tale of ancient
Rome; instead, it is modern high comedy. Full of mirthful surprises.
So far as known, the first strictly humorous serial prepared for a young folks’ magazine. Illustrations by Frank T. Merrill.</p>


<p class="unindent"><span class="big">Montezuma’s Gold Mines.</span> By <i>Fred A. Ober</i>, author of “The Silver City.” This serial
of romantic adventure is based on Mr. Ober’s own search
for the lost gold mines of Montezuma, which are firmly believed in Mexico to be still in existence, their precise
locality a guarded secret among one or two tribes of mountain Indians, who inherit the precious knowledge, handing it
down in turn to their children. The hero of the story is “John North,” the hero of “The Silver City,” and the serial
opens on the mysterious island of Cozumel. The story has been written to satisfy the incessant demand and unappeasable
desire of the readers, old as well as young, of “The Silver City.” Illustrations by Hy. Sandham.</p>


<p class="unindent"><span class="big">The Secrets at Roseladies.</span> By <i>Mary Hartwell Catherwood</i>, author of “Rocky Fork,”
and “Old Caravan Days.” It is enough, perhaps, to reveal
here, of Pen Bidgood, and Willie Bidgood, and “Sister” Bidgood, and little Honora Jones, and Aquilla Jones, and
beautiful Sarah Roseladies, and Dan Marsh of the house-boat, that <i>one</i> of their secrets concerned the secrets of the Indian
Mounds on the Lower Wabash. Illustrations by W. A. Rogers.</p>


<p class="unindent"><span class="big">Howling Wolf and His Trick-Pony.</span> By <i>Mrs. Lizzie W. Champney</i>. The
hair-breadth adventures of a bright

<p class="unindent"><span class="big">Bird-Talk.</span> By <i>Mrs. A. D. T. Whitney</i>. For some time Mrs. Whitney has been making a study of our
wild birds and their individual song expression; and from that study comes now a delicious
group of poems, each descriptive of a bird and its haunts, and each including a metrical rendering of that bird’s song,
based on the true vowel sounds in the notes of its melody. This dainty and amusing series will be as follows:</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="big">In War-Times at La Rose Blanche.</span> By <i>Mrs. M. E. M. Davis</i>. Twelve stories,
written by a prominent New Orleans
lady, the wife of a Confederate cavalry officer. They relate the adventures of a great Southern sugar-plantation household,
whose men were in the army from the beginning to the end of the Civil War. The author was a little girl at
the time—the “Miss Ma’y” of the stories—and was concerned in many little dramas, some humorous and some pathetic,
in which both “Blue-coats” and “Gray-coats” were actors. “The Letter from the Front,” describing the Battle of the
Wilderness, in which her brother of fifteen was a color-bearer in Hood’s Brigade, is said by both Union and Confederate
officers to be one of the best descriptions ever written of what one soldier sees and feels in a battle. Some hundreds of
“house and field hands” belonged to La Rose Blanche plantation, and the “dialect” is not one of the least of the charms
of these stories. Illustrations by E. W. Kemble.</p>


<p class="unindent"><span class="big">Ballads about Old-Time Authors.</span> By <i>Harriet Prescott Spofford</i>. In twelve
picturesque ballads Mrs. Spofford will
relate some tender stories from the lives of the masters of the earlier English literature—that one of “Goldsmith’s Whistle,”
and that one of Johnson doing penance in Uttoxeter Market, and of Milton blind, and of Lamb and his sister—and
many another beautiful literary story with which young people ought to be made familiar. These ballads will be richly
and authentically illustrated by Edmund H. Garrett.</p>


<p class="unindent"><span class="big">Famous Pets.</span> By <i>Eleanor Lewis</i>. A series of papers which have been in preparation at home and
abroad for several years, comprising among their treasures rich contributions of facts,
anecdotes, descriptions, engravings and photographs from many noted people who have owned interesting pets: for instance,
the first paper, “Some Scotch Celebrities,” narrates an interesting talk with the old keeper of Grayfriar’s Churchyard,
where the famous “Grayfriar’s Bobby” lived and died, and another chat with the sister of Dr. John Brown, author
of “Rab and his Friends,” with an engraving from a charming photographed group of Dr. Brown, Dr. Peddie and
“Dandie,” and half a dozen pictures from paintings, statues and photographs.</p>


<p class="unindent"><span class="big">“Fairy Folk All.”</span> By <i>Louise Imogen Guiney</i>. Twelve Papers. Researches in fairy-land, giving

and puckwudjies, of kelpies and kobolds—in short, of all the known races of “the little vanishing folk,” with
accounts of their dress, haunts, habits, manners, customs and usages. Full of delicious anecdote and legend, and with
bewitching pictures.</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="big">Search-Questions in Greek History.</span> <span class="smcap">With Monthly Prizes.</span> By <i>Oscar
Fay Adams</i>. The value everywhere set
upon the past two years’ work with Search-Questions in Literature, and the cordial help afforded to the young “searchers”

<p class='adtitle2'>SPECIAL HOLIDAY BOOKS.</p>

<p>The special Holiday Book list of Messrs.
D. Lothrop &amp; Co. and their general Booklist
for the season embrace volumes of fresh
beauty, and also sterling works fully abreast
with the growing demand for attractive books
of some educational value. Their array of
costly illustrated volumes includes seven Fine-Art
issues. Foremost is the magnificent
folio, <span class="smcap">Idyls and Pastorals</span>, comprising
twenty-four poems by Celia Thaxter written
expressly for this work, accompanied by
twenty-four superb fac-simile photogravures
from paintings, water colors and line drawings
by eminent American and foreign artists,
including Kate Greenaway, Howard Pyle,
Wm. T. Smedley, Edmund H. Garrett, F.
Childe Hassam, Jessie Curtis Shepherd,
Miss L. B. Humphrey, W. L. Taylor, Joseph
Pennell, Thomas Hovenden, F. H. Lungren,
T. W. Wood, N. A., Charles Volkmar, Hy.
Sandham, F. T. Merrill and Henry Bacon.
These photogravures are printed by hand,
in colors, on the finest imported India paper.
The book is bound in vellum cloth with designs
in two metals, also in white calf embossed
in imitation of antique carved ivory.
A Popular Edition, octavo, with a selection,
and fine wood engravings is bound both in
cloth and embossed leather. <span class="smcap">Youth in
Twelve Centuries</span> is another <i>de luxe</i> folio,
holding twenty-four bold picturesque drawings
by Hassam of youthful race-types of
both sexes, ranging from Egyptian, 1500 <span class="smcap">B.
C.</span>, down through Chinese, Greek, Roman,
Scandinavian, Gaul, to the Renaissance of
the Medici and the American Colonial.
These drawings are in hand-printed photogravures
in twelve tones, and are accompanied
by twenty-four poems by “M. E. B.”
The book is in two styles of binding: in rich
silk canvas from the New York Associated
Artists’ art-fabrics with emerald calf corners
and back, and in linen fabric overprinted in
photogravure with a rich and mystic design.
<span class="smcap">A Popular Edition</span> of the same, with wood
engravings, is bound in fine cloth. <span class="smcap">The
Minute Man</span>, by Margaret Sidney, is a Ballad

Concord views in toned photogravures.
Beautiful binding. In <span class="smcap">Bye-o-Baby Ballads</span>,
the “color-book” of the House, the little folks
have a volume as perfect in taste as the
costly adult gift-books; the ballads are by
Charles Stuart Pratt (editor of <span class="smcap">Wide Awake</span>
and <span class="smcap">Babyland</span>), and the pictures, by Hassam,
the popular water-color painter, include many
strong charming full-pages and hundreds
smaller, reproduced in exquisite colors by
Buek &amp; Co.; withal, the book is distinctively
fresh and American. <span class="smcap">Sonnets from the
Portuguese</span>. The immortal love-sonnets by
Elizabeth Barrett Browning are so richly
printed and bound as to become a standard
presentation volume. New editions of recent
favorite gift-books group with these new
ones, notably <span class="smcap">Ideal Poems</span>, <span class="smcap">Heroines of
the Poets</span> and <span class="smcap">Stabat Mater</span>.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">YOUNG Joseph sat on the side of his bed,
one boot on, the other still held by the
strap, while he stared somewhat crossly at a
small green paper-covered book which lay open
beside him.</p>

<p>“A dozen of them!” he said at last. “Just
to think of a fellow making such a silly promise
as that! A verse a month, straight through a
whole year. Got to pick ’em out, too. I’d
rather have ’em picked out for me; less trouble.</p>

<p>“How did I happen to promise her I’d do it?
I don’t know which verse to take. None of ’em
fit me, nor have a single thing to do with a <i>boy</i>!
Well, that’ll make it all the easier for me, I
s’pose. I’ve got to hurry, anyhow, so here
goes; I’ll take the shortest there is here.”</p>

<p>And while he drew on the other boot, and
made haste to finish his toilet, he rattled off,
many times over, the second verse at the head of
this story.</p>

<p>The easiest way to make you understand
about Joseph, is to give you a very brief account
of his life.</p>

<p>He was twelve years old, and an orphan. The
only near relative he had in the world was his
sister Jean aged sixteen, who was learning millinery
in an establishment in the city. The little
family though very poor, had kept together until
mother died in the early spring. Now it was
November, and during the summer, Joseph had
lived where he could; working a few days for
his bread, first at one house, then at another;
never because he was really needed, but just out
of pity for his homelessness. Jean could earn
her board where she was learning her trade, but
not his; though she tried hard to bring this
about.</p>

<p>At last, a home for the winter opened to
Joseph. The Fowlers who lived on a farm and
had in the large old farmhouse a private school
for a dozen girls, spent a few weeks in the town
where Joseph lived, and carried him away with
them, to be errand boy in general, and study between
times.</p>

<p>Poor, anxious Jean drew a few breaths of relief
over the thought of her boy. That, at least,
meant pure air, wholesome food, and a chance
to learn something.</p>

<p>Now for his promise. Jean had studied over
it a good deal before she claimed it. Should it
be to read a few verses in mother’s Bible every
day? No; because a boy always forgot to do
so, for a week at a time, and then on Sunday
afternoon rushed through three or four chapters
as a salve to his conscience, not noticing a sentence
in them. At last she determined on this:
the little green book of golden texts, small
enough to carry in his jacket pocket! Would he
promise her to take—should she say each week’s
text as a sort of rule to live by?</p>

<p>No; that wouldn’t do. Joseph would never
make so close a promise as that. Well, how
would a verse a month do, chosen by himself from
the Golden Texts?</p>

<p>On this last she decided; and this, with some
hesitancy, Joseph promised. So here he was, on
Thanksgiving morning, picking out his first text.
He had chosen the shortest, as you see; there
was another reason for the choice. It pleased
him to remember that he had no lambs to feed,
and there was hardly a possibility that the verse
could fit him in any way during the month. He
was only bound by his promise to be guided by
the verse if he happened to think of it, and if it
suggested any line of action to him.</p>

<p>“It’s the jolliest kind of a verse,” he said, giving
his hair a rapid brushing. “When there are
no lambs around, and nothing to feed ’em, I’d
as soon live by it for a month as not.”</p>

<p>Voices in the hall just outside his room: “I
don’t know what to do with poor little Rettie to-day,”
said Mrs. Calland, the married daughter
who lived at home with her fatherless Rettie.</p>

<p>“The poor child will want everything on the
table, and it won’t do for her to eat anything
but her milk and toast. I am so sorry for her.
You know she is weak from her long illness; and
it is <i>so</i> hard for a child to exercise self control
about eating. If I had anyone to leave her with
I would keep her away from the table; but every
one is so busy.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Miss Addie, one of the sisters: “How
would it do to have our new Joseph stay with
her?”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” said the new Joseph, puckering
his lips into an indignant sniff and brushing his
hair the wrong way, in his excitement; “I
guess I won’t, though. Wait for the second
table on Thanksgiving Day, when every scholar
in the school is going to sit down to the first!
That would be treating me exactly like one of
the family with a caution! Just you try it, Miss
Addie, and see how quick I’ll cut and run.”</p>

<p>But Mrs. Calland’s soft voice was replying:
“Oh! I wouldn’t like to do that. Joseph is sensitive,
and a stranger, and sitting down to the
Thanksgiving feast in its glory, is a great event
for him; it would hurt me to deprive him of it.”</p>

<p>“Better not,” muttered Joseph, but there was
a curious lump in his throat, and a very tender
feeling in his heart toward Mrs. Calland.</p>

<p>It was very strange, in fact it was absurd, but
all the time Joseph was pumping water, and filling
pitchers, and bringing wood and doing the
hundred other things needing to be done this
busy morning, that chosen verse sounded itself
in his brain: “He saith unto him, feed my lambs.”
More than that, it connected itself with frail little
Rettie and the Thanksgiving feast.</p>

<p>In vain did Joseph say “Pho!” “Pshaw!”
“Botheration!” or any of the other words with
which boys express disgust. In vain did he tell
himself that the verse didn’t mean any such thing;
he guessed he wasn’t a born idiot. He even
tried to make a joke out of it, and assure himself
that this was exactly contrary to the verse; it
was a plan by means of which the “lamb” should
<i>not</i> get fed. It was all of no use. The verse
and his promise, kept by him the whole morning,
actually sent him at last to Mrs. Calland with
the proposal that he should take little Rettie to
the schoolroom and amuse her, while the grand
dinner was being eaten.</p>

<p>I will not say that he had not a lingering hope
in his heart that Mrs. Calland would refuse his
sacrifice. But his hope was vain. Instant relief
and gratitude showed in the mother’s eyes
and voice. And Joseph carried out his part so
well that Rettie, gleeful and happy every minute
of the long two hours, did not so much as think
of the dinner.</p>

<p>“You are a good, kind boy,” said Mrs. Calland,
heartily. “Now run right down to dinner;
we saved some nice and warm for you.”</p>

<p>Yes, it was warm: but the great fruit pudding
was spoiled of its beauty, and the fruit pyramid
had fallen, and the workers were scraping dishes
and hurrying away the remains of the feast,
while he ate, and the girls were out on the lawn
playing tennis and croquet, double sets at both,
and no room for him, and the glory of everything
had departed. The description of it all, which
he had meant to write to Jean, would have to
be so changed that there would be no pleasure
in writing it. What had been the use of spoiling
his own day? No one would ever know it,
he couldn’t even tell Jean, because of course the
verse didn’t mean any such thing.</p>

<p>“But I don’t see why it pitched into a fellow
so, if it didn’t <i>belong</i>,” he said, rising from the
table just as Ann, the dishwasher, snatched his
plate, for which she had been waiting. “And,
anyhow, I feel kind of glad I did it, whether it
belonged or not.”</p>

<p>“He is a kind-hearted, unselfish boy,” said
Mrs. Calland to her little daughter, that evening,
“and you and mamma must see in how many
ways we can be good to him.”</p>

<p class="dropcapstory">IT was the day before Thanksgiving. Cold
weather had come on early. The ground
had been frozen solid for several days,
and the country roads were “smooth as glass”;
so Grandpa Kirke said when he came home from
the post-office Tuesday afternoon. “But I
shouldn’t wonder if we were to have snow before
morning,” he added. And at this the little
granddaughter Lucy L. clapped her hands gleefully.
The boy Whittier said nothing, but presently
a noise was heard up in the wood-house
chamber, and Mrs. Kirke said in a startled tone,
“What’s that?”</p>

<p>Grandpa stepped to the door and called,
“Whittier!”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 562px;">
<img src="images/i-006.jpg" width="562" height="428" alt="two children taking to man with bicycle" />
<div class="caption">“GRANDMA KIRKE MIGHT GIVE YOU A BREAKFAST.”</div>
</div>

<p>“Sir?” responded the boy quickly.</p>

<p>“Oh! you are there.”</p>

<p>“Coming in a minute; do you want anything?”
said Whittier, and in less than a minute the boy
appeared below stairs with his sled. “Looks
pretty well to start on a second winter with!”
he said, as he dusted and examined the treasure.
“Say, Lucy Larcom, how will you like to ride to
school on the Flyaway to-morrow morning?”</p>

<p>Grandma laughed, and said, “You seem to be
counting on snow, for sure.”</p>

<p>“But you know grandpa said maybe it would
snow, and when grandpa says maybe, it most always
comes so,” said Lucy.</p>

<p>Sure enough snow lay on the ground, pure
and white, to the depth of several inches when
they looked out that morning before Thanksgiving
Day. The children could scarcely be prevailed
upon to eat their breakfast, so eager were
they to get off to school with the Flyaway.
Grandma said:</p>

<p>“This won’t last long; snow that falls upon
frozen ground never stays. It is the snow that
comes in the mud that makes sleighing to last.”
This somewhat chilled their expectations, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Lucy concluded that the snow would last until
recess, anyway. As the two started off grandma,
watching them from the window, said with a sigh,
“How much Whittier looks like our John at his
age!”</p>

<p>“God forbid that he should grow up to remind
you of John!” replied Mr. Kirke, almost
bitterly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Kirke washed the dishes and tidied the
room in silence, then stepping to her husband’s
side she laid her hand upon his shoulder, and
said softly, “Joseph, to-morrow is Thanksgiving
Day!”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“I have made the pies and the pudding and
the plum cake that John always liked so well,
and now if John should come home?”</p>

<p>“Well?” this time the monosyllable was
spoken a trifle less impatiently.</p>

<p>“If he should come home you would receive
him? Remember, Joseph, John is our first-born.”</p>

<p>“’Tain’t no ways likely he’ll come!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know; someway I’ve been thinking
lik’sanyway he’ll be thinking about the old home
when Thanksgiving comes round. Anyway, I’ve
made them things for him, but then,” she added,
more to herself than to her husband, “I’m always
ready for him. The bed is always made
up for him, and there is always something cooked
that he likes.”</p>

<p>Meantime the children had gone on their way,
Whittier drawing his sister upon the Flyaway,
bending all his energies to the task, for the sledding
was not very good, so it happened that Lucy
was the first to spy a strange sight for that part
of the country.</p>

<p>“Look, Whitty! what is that coming?” exclaimed
his sister.</p>

<p>Then Whittier stopped, and Lucy in her excitement
jumped off the sled and stood beside
him, half-frightened.</p>

<p>“Why, that must be one of them things they
call a bicycle!” said the boy; “I’ve read a lot
about them, and Tom Green saw one in Galway
when he was over there staying with his uncle.
I guess this is the first one ever got around this
way. My! how he skims along. But I wish
he would stop, so we could see the machine
better.”</p>

<p>As if divining the boy’s wish, the bicyclist
came to a stand-still and dismounted as he
reached the place where the children waited.</p>

<p>“Halloo, my boy! How’ll you swap? I think
I’d like to go coasting this morning; those hills
over there look as though they might give a
chance for some sport.”</p>

<p>“Say,” continued the stranger without giving
Whittier a chance to speak, “do you s’pose a
fellow could get a breakfast anywhere around
here?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied Whittier slowly. “I
guess, though, that grandma would give you some.
I’ve heard her say she never could find it in her
heart to turn a tramp away because maybe uncle
John might be wanting something to eat and she
would want somebody to give him a meal.”</p>

<p>The stranger stooped down and seemed to be
brushing the snow off the wheel, and when he
spoke it was in a very quiet tone:</p>

<p>“Where does grandma live, and what is her
name?”</p>

<p>“Her name is Grandma Kirke, and she lives
over there in the white house you see by the red
barn.”</p>

<p>“And is there a Grandpa Kirke?”</p>

<p>“Of course! we’d have to have a grandpa or
we couldn’t get along, could we?” said Lucy,
startled out of her shyness at the thought that
there could be a house without a grandpa.</p>

<p>“There is just Grandpa and Grandma Kirke
and us,” said Whittier; “we used to have an
uncle John, though Lucy Larcom and I came
here after he went away. He has been gone
five years, but you better not say anything about
him if you go there, because it always makes
grandma cry.”</p>

<p>“And does grandpa cry?”</p>

<p>“No; he only looks sober, but I guess he
feels awful bad about uncle John, for he says
it was rum that made him go off, and grandpa
hates rum like poison. He won’t have even
cider in the house, and he always votes against
rum too.”</p>

<p>“And don’t grandma make currant wine and
keep it in the cellar for Thanksgiving and Christmas?”
asked the stranger.</p>

<p>“My! no! grandma hates everything that has
alcohol in it. She wouldn’t have it anywhere
around; but she will give you a cup of coffee, I
guess.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>“And you think she would be glad to see
John?”</p>

<p>“I know she would!” Then as a thought
flashed into his mind, the boy said suddenly,
“Say, if you go riding around the country much
on that machine maybe you’ll come across my
uncle; if you do, just tell him grandma keeps
things all ready for him, ’specting him to come,
will you?”</p>

<p>“All right, I will; good-by!” and mounting
his wheel the stranger rode off towards the
little white house which Whittier had pointed
out. “As if I didn’t know that house and every
room in it!” he said, talking to himself. “And
so grandma keeps things ready for her wandering
son!” and here he lifted his hand to brush
away something from his cheek.</p>

<p>It could not have been a fly that frosty morning,
could it?</p>

<p>I have not space to tell you of the stranger’s
reception at the farmhouse. There must have
been joy in heaven over the returning repentant
prodigal; and what a Thanksgiving that was!
When the next day the sons and daughters gathered
for the feast, and found this long-absent
brother returned, their cup of joy and thanksgiving
seemed to overflow. But I want to tell you
of a bit of talk that took place when uncle John
had gathered the children all about him in the
afternoon.</p>

<p>They were examining the bicycle, and he
had been telling them some incidents of his
long journey, when suddenly he said, “Now,
children, you think this is a nice thing, and you
boys quite envy your old uncle its possession,
don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Not quite that, I guess,” replied one of the
older boys, “but I’d like to own one.”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps your father will buy this; I
want to sell it.” At this they all looked aghast
to think their uncle would be willing to part with
such a treasure.</p>

<p>“Just let me tell you something, boys,” he
continued; “I am forty years old, and all I possess
in the world is this bicycle and a very few
dollars which I have earned since I became a
sober man. I have thrown away the best part
of my life. Here are my brothers with comfortable
homes all their own, and I with nothing, and
all because of rum! and I began by drinking
cider over there at the mill. Boys, let it alone;
don’t begin, and you will never be the slave of
rum.”</p>

<p>“But, uncle John,” said one, “you are not a
slave any more.”</p>

<p>“No; but I shall carry the marks of my fetters
to the grave. I tell you it hasn’t paid.
Forty years old, and nothing to show for my
life! Sign the pledge, boys; sign the pledge,
and you will not have to say that when you are
forty years old. I trust you will have something
more than a bicycle to show for it.”</p>

<p class="spacedp"><span class="smcap">The</span> room in which the infidel Voltaire once
predicted the speedy overthrow of Christianity,
is now used as a Bible depository.</p>

<p class="spacedp"><span class="smcap">Three</span> missionaries have been recently murdered:
Rev. John Houghton and wife of Golbanti,
East Africa, and Bishop Hannington.</p>

<p class="spacedp"><span class="smcap">Not</span> long ago, a Mr. Green, president of a temperance
society of England, destroyed the contents
of his wine-cellar, valued at three thousand
dollars.</p>

<p class="spacedp"><span class="smcap">We</span> are glad to hear that the government of
Japan has forbidden the lecturing against Christianity,
by “Yaso Taiji,” or Jesus opposers, believing
it to be damaging to the country.</p>

<p class="spacedp"><span class="smcap">We</span> hear of a church in Iowa which is very
new, and not yet furnished. Just now the Sunday-school
scholars are seated on rough boards
resting on boxes. But this is a good beginning.</p>

<p class="spacedp"><span class="smcap">A little</span> over twenty-five years ago Sunday-schools
were introduced into Sweden. Now
there are two hundred thousand Sunday-school
scholars and twenty thousand teachers in the

<p class="spacedp"><span class="smcap">There</span> is a saloon in the city of Cincinnati,

<p class="spacedp"><span class="smcap">Before</span> the war, a slave was beaten terribly by

<p class="spacedp"><span class="smcap">A minister</span> of Kansas said that he once took

Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ
is all, and in all.”</p>

<p class="spacedp"><span class="smcap">The</span> Societies of Christian Endeavor, among
the young people, are growing, all over the country.
There is a thriving one in a little church in
New York State, of which we know. They recently
gave a “lawn party” and raised money to
fresco, paint, carpet, and partially seat the chapel
of the church. They also have an “envelope
fund,” and each member brings weekly some
regular amount. Half of this goes to regular
church expenses, and half to anything for which
they vote to use it.</p>

<p class="spacedp"><span class="smcap">In</span> Southern Ohio last spring there was a little
brick church, the wall-paper of which had peeled
off. The walls were dirty, the matting in the aisles
was dirty, the seats were ugly, and the chandeliers
hung from the ceiling by ropes. The people
were discouraged, and thought nothing could
be done. But some money was raised, and the
walls were re-papered, the seats oiled and grained,
a new carpet put down, the chandeliers hung
nicely, and now such a pretty little church
as it is! If you could have seen it the Sunday
before it was fixed, and the Sunday after, you
would have thought it a wonderful transformation,
indeed.</p>

<p class="spacedp"><span class="smcap">Rev. Mr. Meade</span>, of New York State, who
has been in the temperance work among the colored
people of the South, says he was present at
a conference of their church, when the ministers
were bringing up the money from the churches.
One man brought “all de money he could raise,”
and then took a shining silver dollar. “Dat,”
said he, “is from me, for de home missionary
cause. And dat,” taking out another, “for the
foreign missionary cause. And,” turning to Mr.
Meade, “if I had another cent, I’d gib it to you,
for de temperance work, but I have to walk home
thirty miles now, widout money to pay my
fare.” Mr. Meade gave him a chance to bring up
a package from the depot, and he was delighted
to earn twenty-five cents for “de temperance
cause.”</p>

<p class="drop-capi2">MARGARET was washing the dishes;
making a vigorous clash and spatter,
and setting down the cups so hard that
had they been anything but the good
solid iron-stone which they were, they would
certainly have suffered under the treatment.</p>

<p>Margaret was noisy in all things, but to-day
the usual vigor of movement was manifestly increased
by ill humor. There was an ominous
setting of a pair of firm lips, and all her face was
in a frown. The knives and forks, when their
turn came, seemed to increase her ire. She rattled
and flung them about with such reckless
disregard of consequences that there landed,
presently, a lovely tricolored globe of foam in
the centre of John’s arithmetic, over which he
was at this moment gloomily bending.</p>

<p>“Look here,” he said, half fiercely, half comically,
“quit that, will you? This thing is dry
enough, I know; but it will take more than soap
suds to dampen it.”</p>

<p>“Take your book out of my way, then. What
do you s’pose <i>she</i> would say to its being on the
table and you bending double over it?”</p>

<p>“She may say just exactly what she pleases.
It will stay on the table until I get ready to take
it off.”</p>

<p>“O yes! you’re very brave until you hear her
coming, and then you are as meek as Moses.”</p>

<p>“Now I say, Mag, that’s mean in you, when
you know well enough that all I’m after is to try
to keep the peace.”</p>

<p>“Peace! there isn’t enough of that article left
in this house to make it worth while to try to
save it. I’m sick to death of the whole thing.”
And the knives bumped about against a plate in
the dish-pan with such force that the plate rebelled
and flew into three pieces in its rage.</p>

<p>“There goes another dish!” exclaimed West,
from the window corner where he was busily
whittling; “that makes the seventeenth this
week, doesn’t it? Mag, you are awful, and no
mistake.”</p>

<p>Then Margaret’s face flamed and her angry
words burst their bounds: “I wish you would
just mind your own business, Weston Moore!
You think because you are eighteen months and
seven days older than I, that you can order me
around like a slave.”</p>

<p>“Whew! bless my eyes! How you do blaze
out on a fellow! Who thought of ordering you
around? I should as soon think of ordering a
cyclone. I was only moralizing on the sweet
and amiable mood you were in, and the nice comfortable
times we have in this house.”</p>

<p>“Well, you may let my moods alone if you
please; and my dishes too. I’ve a right to
break them all if I choose, for all you. I’d rather
blaze up in a rage, than be an everlasting tease
and torment, like you.”</p>

<p>“Father’ll have a word to say about the
dishes, I fancy, my lady; you might now and
then think of him: he isn’t made of gold, I s’pose
you know, and dishes cost money.”</p>

<p>“I do think of him a great deal oftener than
you do, you great lazy, whittling, whistling boy!
If it wasn’t for him I’d run away, and be rid of
her and you, and all the other nuisances, dishes
and all.”</p>

<p>She paused in her clatter long enough to dash
away two or three great tears which were plashing
down her hot red cheeks.</p>

<p>“As to that,” said the whittler, as he slowly
closed his jack-knife, “perhaps you better seriously
consider it. I’m not sure but it would be
more comfortable for all concerned; especially
the dishes.” Then he spied the tears; and seizing
upon the dish towel which had been angrily
flung across the back of a chair, he rushed toward
his sister, exclaiming: “Here, let me wipe away
those briny drops.”</p>

<p>Margaret’s hands were in the dishwater again,
but she drew them forth all dripping with the
greasy suds, and brought the right one with a
resounding slap, about the curly head of the
mocking boy.</p>

<p>Just how he would have received it will not
be known; for the sudden jerk backwards of the
left arm, came against the full dish-pan, already
set too near the edge of the table, and over it
went, deluging table, floor, and Margaret’s dress
not only, but pouring a greasy flood over the
rows of bread tins carefully covered, and set in
a sheltered corner for the dough to rise.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>Margaret’s exclamation of dismay was suddenly
checked, and the angry color flamed back
into her eyes as the door leading into the hall
opened, and a woman appeared on the scene—a
tall, pale woman in a plain, dark, close-fitting
calico dress, without a collar, and with dark,
almost black hair combed straight back from a
plain face. She gave a swift glance at the confusion,
and took in the situation.</p>

<p>“Quarreling again! I might have known it.
Were you three ever together in your lives,
without it? John, let the book alone until it dries;
if it had not been on the kitchen table where I
told you never to have it, the dishwater wouldn’t
have ruined it. And the bread too! I declare!
This is too bad!” These last words came in detached
sentences as the extent of the misfortune
grew upon her.</p>

<p>A quick snatch of the carefully tucked cloth,
now holding little pools of dishwater, a comprehension
of the utter ruin of the many loaves
of bread, and she turned upon the wrathful girl:</p>

<p>“Margaret, go upstairs this minute, and don’t
venture down again until you are called. I’m
sure I wish you need never come.”</p>

<p>“You can’t begin to wish it as I do.” This
was Margaret’s last bitter word as she shot out
of the door.</p>

<p>John stood dolefully surveying his soaking
arithmetic, and his great sheet of now ruined
examples, carefully worked out. The woman
was already tucking up her calico dress ready for
work, but she had a message for him.</p>

<p>“Now <i>you</i> go <i>some</i>where; don’t let me see
you until dinner time. And mind, I shall tell
your father you have disobeyed me again.”</p>

<p>As for Weston the tease, he had slipped
swiftly and silently from the room with the entrance
of the mother.</p>

<p>Yes, she was their mother. At least, she was
their father’s wife, though none of the three had
ever called her by the name of mother. A curious
position she held in the home, bound by
solemn pledge to do a mother’s duty by these
three children, yet receiving from none of them
a shred of the love, or respect, or true obedience,
which the name mother ought to call forth.</p>

<p>Poor Mrs. Moore! I do hope you are sorry for
her. Sorry for the children, are you? Well, so
am I.</p>

<p>Indeed it is true, they every one need pity and
help. The question is, Will they get what they
need?</p>

<p>Upstairs, angry Margaret made haste to remove
her much soiled dress, eyes flashing, and
cheeks burning the while. Something more
than the scenes we watched in the kitchen had
to do with Margaret’s mood.</p>

<p>A green and prickly chestnut bur came whizzing
into the room, landing in the middle of her
bed.</p>

<p>It called forth an angry exclamation. Here was
some more of that tormenting West’s work. She
would not stand it! She made a rush for the
window, but a low, merry laugh stopped her.
This was not West’s laugh.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Hester Andrews, from under the
chestnut-tree, “can you go?”</p>

<p>“No; of course I can’t. I should think you
might know without asking. Do I ever go anywhere
now days?”</p>

<p>“It is just too mean for anything!” declared
Hester. “What reason does she give this
time?”</p>

<p>There was a peculiar emphasis on the word
“this,” which was meant to indicate that here
was only one of the numberless times in which
Margaret Moore had been shamefully treated,
Margaret answered the tone as well as the words.</p>

<p>“Oh! father says he can’t have me out so late
in the evening; it isn’t the thing for a little girl,
and he doesn’t approve of sail boats, anyway.
As if I didn’t know where all that stuff came
from!”</p>

<p>“The idea! I declare, it’s a perfect shame.
Wouldn’t you like to see your own mother keeping
you at home from places, and treating you
like a baby, or a slave, as she does?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you speak my mother’s name the same
day you do <i>hers</i>,” said Margaret, with fierce
voice and flashing eyes.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m sure I don’t wonder that you feel
so,” was Hester’s soothing answer. “I’m just
as sorry for you as I can be; I wonder sometimes
that you don’t run away. Every one says it
comes harder on you, because you are a girl:
the boys can keep out of her sight. O Mag! I’m
so sorry you can’t go. If <i>your</i> mother were only
here, what lovely times we could have?”</p>

<p>And this was the help which Margaret’s most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
intimate friend brought her! In point of fact,
these two knew no more of what the mourned
mother would have done, than did the squirrels
up in the chestnut-tree. She had been lying in
the cemetery for a year when Hester Andrews’
family moved into the town, and Margaret was
only a busy little elf of not quite six, when she
received with gleeful laughter her mother’s last
kiss. What did she know how the mother would
treat the thirteen-year-old girl’s longings for sail
boats and evening parties?</p>

<p>Downstairs, Mrs. Moore left to solitude and
bitter thoughts, worked with swift, skilled fingers,
and set lips. Not long alone; some one came
to help her—a sister, married, and living at ease
in a lovely home only a few streets away; a younger
sister who was sorry, so blindly and unwisely
sorry for the elder’s harder lot, that she could not
keep back her words of indignant sympathy.</p>

<div class="caption">“SOME ONE CAME TO HELP HER.”</div>
</div>

<p>“It’s a shame!” she said, “just a burning
shame, the way you are treated by those children.
The idea of your being down on your knees
mopping up the musses which they have made,
on purpose to vex you. If I were you, Sophia,
I wouldn’t endure it another day. It is a wonder
to me that their father permits such a state
of things. Henry and I were speaking of it last
night.”</p>

<p>“Their father doesn’t know the half that goes
on,” Mrs. Moore said, speaking quickly in defence
of her husband. “What is the use? We
live in an uproar all the time, as it is. And after
all, Emma, they are his children.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care. You are his wife. You owe
something to your self respect. Henry thinks so
too; he thinks it is a shame. Why do you go
on the floor and clean after them? Isn’t that girl
as able to mop up her dishwater as you are?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Moore wrung the wet, greasy cloth with
a nervous grip, letting some of the soiled drops
trickle down her arm, in her haste, and answered
with eyes that glowed:</p>

<p>“To tell the truth, I would scrub the floor
after her all day, for the sake of getting her out
of my sight for an hour.”</p>

<p>And this was the help Mrs. Moore received.</p>

<p class="dropcapstory">VARIOUS exclamations greeted Nell
Erwin as she entered the schoolroom
and drew out her work—a coarse gray
woollen sock.</p>

<p>It was “Fancy Friday” at Daisy Hill
Seminary—something peculiar to the place.
Three Fridays out of the month were spent in
the customary elocutionary exercises, but the
afternoon of the fourth was spent in a cosey,
informal way, the girls, both day scholars and
boarders, bringing their fancy work, and Madam
Lane reading to them from some standard work.</p>

<p>At the present time she was in the midst of a
translation of the Iliad, but I fear that in spite
of Madam’s clear and beautiful rendition, “Jove,
the cloud-gatherer,” “Juno, the ox-eyed,” and
the other Homeric worthies, were less fascinating
than “rick-rack” and “Kensington
stitches.”</p>

<p>On this particular Friday, there was a brilliant
display of fancy work. Helen Grant was
embroidering a pair of slippers—splendid purple
and yellow pansies; Lulu Fletcher a sofa
pillow—a cluster of lilies on cardinal satin;
Katie Lee was at work on an elaborate stand-spread;
Mary Morse was crocheting a fleecy
white shawl; Carrie Evans was making an applique
bracket; a dozen or so girls were deep
in the delightful mysteries of “crazy quilts”;
and—but, dear me! I have not the time to
enumerate all the beautiful things! Seats and
desks were covered with a dazzling array of silks
and worsteds.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>So you see it was no wonder that Nell’s humble
gray sock created such a sensation. However,
though she blushed a little at the pleasantries of
her mates, she took her seat and courageously
set to work.</p>

<p>“Why, Nell! I thought you were going to
bring that lovely foot-rest!” said Helen Grant.
“You told me yesterday that you were going to
finish it to-day. Have you it already done?”</p>

<p>“O no!”</p>

<p>“Then why under the sun didn’t you bring
it instead of this solemn old sock!”</p>

<p>Nell blushed still redder, then she said hesitatingly,
“Well, you see, girls, I <i>did</i> think I’d
bring the foot-rest. In fact I had it all done up
in my work-bag, and then I remembered that I
would need a pair of scissors. So I went to
mother’s work-basket, and, girls, in rummaging
around there, I got an idea!”</p>

<p>“An idea in a work-basket! How very remarkable!
Now I shall know where to go when
I am obliged to write a composition and can’t
think of anything to say!” said Maude Hasket.</p>

<p>“What I mean is this,” said Nell earnestly;
“I found that work-basket full—yes, full to
overflowing—with things to mend, make and fix!
There were Billy’s mittens to mend; the baby’s
petticoats to be shortened; buttons to be sewed
on Kitty’s apron; a patch in Tom’s jacket, and
all for my dear little mother’s one pair of tired
hands! And all to be done this afternoon or
evening! I tell you, girls, I felt ashamed when
I looked at my own nonsensical piece of fancywork!
And then and there I made up my mind
to do something towards lessening the contents
of that basket. So I grabbed up this sock, for
I remembered hearing mother say only a few
days ago that father needed a new pair. I’m
not much of a hand at knitting, but I’ll do all I
can this afternoon, working on the leg, and when
I get home to-night, mother’ll show me about
fixing the heel.”</p>

<p>There was a short silence.</p>

<p>Presently Maude said, “Well, girls, I dare say
the most of us have mothers whose work-baskets
are in the condition of the one Nell has described!
I’ve no doubt that I can find one in my own
home! There are six of us children—four
younger than myself. It would take one
woman’s time to keep our little Ben in anything
like decent order! He is a veritable Peggotty
for button-bursting! And sister Flo is almost
as bad! She’s a perfect Tomboy! Tears regular
barn-door holes in her apron!”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s pretty much the same at our
house,” observed Maggie Gray. “Of course there
are not so many of us, but still mother’s sewing,
mending and darning about all the time.”</p>

<p>“And mine too!” said Laura Harris. “It
was only last evening that I heard father ask
mother if she wouldn’t go to the lecture with
him, and she said she would like to very much,
but couldn’t go, because she had to patch Jack’s
trousers so that he could wear them to school
the next day. And I sat there like an unfeeling
wretch, working on a silly, good-for-nothing
lamp-mat! And mother did look so tired and
wistful, poor darling! Father seemed disappointed
too. Now I might have offered to do
the patching, and so given her a chance to go.
It would have done her so much good!”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Maude briskly, “I guess we’re
all in the same fix! We have been going on
and doing our own sweet wills, and I for one
propose that we make a change! Suppose we
all agree to go to our respective mother’s mending-basket
and get work from it for our next
Fancy Friday?”</p>

<p>“All right! We will!” chimed the others.</p>

<p>Further conversation on the subject was put
an end to by the entrance of Madam, Iliad in
hand, and for the next hour, the girls were regaled
by the account of Achilles dragging the
body of Hector nine times around the walls of
Troy.</p>

<p>“Four!” chimed the great clock in the hall.</p>

<p>“Young ladies, you are dismissed,” said
Madam, closing her book. “Next time, I think
we will have a little prose instead of poetry. It
will be a change, you know. Good afternoon!”</p>

<p>“Prose instead of poetry,” Maude repeated as
they put on their wraps. “And we’ll have the
prose of sewing instead of its poetry, won’t we?”</p>

<p>And Nell answered by a wave of the gray
woollen sock. “You dear old sock!” she whispered
as she rolled it up, “how I did hate to bring
you this afternoon, for I was so afraid the girls
would make piles of fun! But it all turned out
nicely, after all, and you had a mission, didn’t
you, you humble thing!”</p>

<h2>THEY “TWO AGREED.”</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-m.jpg" width="67" height="114" alt="M"/>
</div>

<p class="drop-capi2">MISS RAINES was very earnest that
day. Deb and Dora noticed as she
bent over them and whispered, “Where
two agree, just two, dear ones,” that
her face was filled with a strange light.</p>

<p>They went home from Sabbath-school, wondering
about that promise and why their teacher
gave them such a tender look as she said “Two,
remember; you are two, dear ones; haven’t you
some great thing you’d like to ask of your
Heavenly Father—something for Thanksgiving
Day? Think now, won’t you? and then just
you <i>two agree</i> to ask Him.”</p>

<p>And she gave each a kiss, and went her way;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
they, theirs. But they turned about to catch one
more sight of their “beautiful teacher.” She
had turned, too, and was looking after them.
She waved her hand with another kiss, and disappeared
around the corner.</p>

<p>On they went their weary way and talked as
to what they should agree to ask. They thought
of a turkey and cranberries and mince pie as it
used to be when papa was “right” and had
work and brought home money, and mamma
bought what she liked. But a turkey and no
papa there to eat it with them, or, if there, to
curse, and mamma crying! that would be no
Thanksgiving for them. Besides, how could
they expect a turkey with no money or friends?
and they two walked on together, wondering
what Miss Raines <i>could</i> mean. Then a thought
struck them, and at once they stopped and their
faces shone like Miss Raine’s, and there on the
street they fairly leaped up and down for joy.</p>

<p>“What is it?” said Deb.</p>

<p>“And what is it, <i>you</i>?” answered Dora.</p>

<p>“Let’s ask Him,” said Deb.</p>

<p>“Let’s,” answered Dora, “but what?”</p>

<p>“To give us our own papa back again.”</p>

<p>“Agreed, Deb; and let’s begin now.”</p>

<p>And away they ran down, down the dirty
street. Dogs barked; ragged boys laughed and
hooted, but Deb and Dora were soon up the old
stairs, into the little dark bedroom, on their
knees.</p>

<p>Just one thing they plead, they two; first Deb,
“Give back our papa,” then Dora, the same.</p>

<p>Then with radiant faces to poor mamma.</p>

<p>Wednesday they two went through the market.</p>

<p>Turkeys, chickens, ducks, by the ton. So
many were buying, their eyes were hungry. But
they could not buy one cent’s worth, not having
even that. Still, somehow, they murmured not,
nor charged God foolishly. They <i>knew</i> there
was a good time coming. They looked from the
fat stalls and smiled into each other’s face.</p>

<p>That evening it was a bare floor at their home,
an almost empty grate, little or no bread, mamma
sad as usual.</p>

<p>But Deb and Dora laughed and chatted joyously
as though they were at a king’s banquet.
They had come from their knees.</p>

<p>Then a knock, and the door slightly opened,
and a turkey, ready for the oven, looked in and
a hand came after it and—dear poor papa after
the hand, and mamma sobbed out something.
Deb and Dora seized the turkey and cranberries,
then bounded into papa’s outstretched arms.
Then they danced about the room as though they
were mad.</p>

<p>Papa had that very morning signed the pledge
and found work, and there was his wages—that
turkey with needful sauce and vegetables.</p>

<p>He was trusted for half a ton of coal. Just
then the coal man rapped at the door to know
where to put it.</p>

<p>The next day was Thanksgiving. They four
went to church. They were shown into a seat
near Miss Raines.</p>

<p>Deb and Dora whispered to her. She whispered
back, “Did not I tell you so?”</p>

<p>That day “poor papa” asked the blessing.
And so ever after.</p>

<p class="drop-capi2">SHE was four and he was six. She sat on
the piano stool, and he stood beside her;
and I, behind the curtain, heard their
talk.</p>

<p>“I picked out the biggest one there was,
and brought it on purpose for you and me.”</p>

<p>“But we mustn’t eat it, because mamma
wouldn’t like it; you know she wouldn’t, Freddy.”</p>

<p>“She wouldn’t care if it didn’t hurt us, and
it <i>wouldn’t</i>. Who ever heard of an apple hurting
anybody? You just take a big bite, and then
I will.”</p>

<p>“No, Freddy, I can’t, and you can’t. Mamma
said if they were hard, we mustn’t.”</p>

<p>“That ain’t so very hard. Mamma is in a
worry. Aunt Mag said it wouldn’t hurt us; she
said mamma worried about things. If she
doesn’t know, she can’t worry. Let’s go behind
the curtain and eat it, then if mamma comes up,
she won’t see us.”</p>

<p>“No, Freddy. God can see us behind the curtain,
as well as he can in this room, and this apple
is as hard as a rock. Now, Freddy, let’s be
<i>true</i>.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Freddy, “we will.”</p>

<h2>THE PEACHES.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap">I &nbsp;ONCE read a story that I want to tell the
Pansies. A man brought some fine luscious
peaches to his four boys and their mother. They
had never seen any peaches before. That evening,
he said, “Well, how did you like the
peaches?” The elder answered, “Father, it was
lovely; I kept the stone, and shall have a tree
for myself some day.”</p>

<p>The father was well pleased with his boy’s
thoughtfulness.</p>

<p>Then the youngest said: “I ate mine and
threw away the stone; mother gave me half of
hers.”</p>

<p>Another spoke up: “I picked up the stone
my brother threw away, and ate the kernel. I
sold my peach, and will buy a dozen with the
money when I go to town.”</p>

<p>“And you, Edmund?” the father asked.</p>

<p>“I took mine to George, who is ill with fever.
I laid it on his bed, and came away.”</p>

<p>“Now, who has done the best?” inquired the
father.</p>

<p>“Brother Edmund,” they all exclaimed, and
his mother embraced him with tears in her
eyes.</p>

<p>From this fable you may learn many valuable
lessons. The first is Prudence and Carefulness;
for, if we all planted stones and trees, we should,
like the Spaniards, have a great abundance of
the good things of life; and we may likewise
learn a lesson of unselfishness, and also be taught
to have a kindly consideration for the sick, to
whom little attentions are very gratifying.</p>

<p>Each one of us could do something to cheer
the many sick-rooms if we faithfully endeavored
so to do, and always kept in mind the motto of
“The Pansy Society.” Let us take the story of
“The Peaches” for our lesson.</p>

<h2>MONTEAGLE.</h2>

<p class='center'><span class="smcap">By Pansy.</span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="splittop" src="images/drop-ya.jpg" alt="Y" width="76" height="22" />

<p class="dropcapstory">“YES,” said Mrs. Hammond, a little sigh in
her voice as she spoke, “Mr. Hart is going
with us; I don’t know how long he
will stay. I’m afraid there is very little
on Monteagle to hold him.”</p>

<p>Two children sat on the extreme end of the
broken steps; one was pale, thin, hollow-eyed
and sorrowful. The other was rosy-cheeked,
chubby, and dirty. The pale one was perhaps
twelve years old; the other, somewhat younger.</p>

<p>“Only hear that name!” said the hollow-eyed
girl. “Monteagle! doesn’t it make you feel
cool just to think it over?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t think it over,” said Rosy Cheek.
“What is it, and where is it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know where it is,” spoken very
wearily, as though it was an effort to speak at all.
“In Heaven, maybe; the word sounds like it.
Monteagle! it must be high, and cool, and still.
I wonder what it feels like to be cool and still?
Oh! how <i>hot</i> it is! O dear me!”</p>

<p>There was such a world of longing and weariness
in the sentence, that Mrs. Hammond turned and
looked curiously at the girl; then uttered a little
exclamation of surprise, and perhaps dismay.</p>

<p>“Who is that girl, and what is the matter
with her?”</p>

<p>The man who was busy with a troublesome
strap which had to do with Mrs. Hammond’s
phaeton, glanced up for a moment, then said:</p>

<p>“That is my girl, ma’am, if you mean the
pale one. There ain’t anything the matter with
her now, only weakness, the doctor says. She’s
had the fever—been dreadful sick. There was
a spell when I thought she wouldn’t pull through,
nohow, but she did, up to a certain p’int, there
she stopped, and there she hangs—jest crawls
about all day; doesn’t eat nothing, and doesn’t
sleep nights, only off and on, you know. I
dunno what to do with her.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hammond looked again at the girl who
had dropped into a listless attitude, a very photograph
of discouraged weakness. The rosy-cheeked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
younger one in a much soiled dress had
slipped away. Mrs. Hammond looked from the
girl to the low, small, tumble-down building on
the steps of which she sat, imagined the room in
which she must spend her nights, imagined the
table at which she must sit down to eat her
“nothing,” and murmured, “Poor thing!” with
another long-drawn sigh.</p>

<p>How could one be expected to gain strength
in such a home as that must be?</p>

<p>“Who takes care of you and your daughter?”</p>

<p>She had turned again to the man at the carriage.
He gave a short half-laugh as he answered
slowly: “Well, as to that, what care we get we
have to give to ourselves. Her and me live
alone; since the boy went to work for his board,
at the meat market, I’ve took care of her the
best I could, since she got on her feet again;
and when she was sick, the neighbors was kind.
The doctor was, too—uncommon kind; stayed
the most of two nights himself, and brought his
woman once or twice to see her; but she’s gone
now, up to Monteagle, along with the rest of
the world. I suppose it is cool up there,
ma’am?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mrs. Hammond, with another
sigh. “It is cool there; poor thing! I don’t
see how she is ever to get well in such a place.”</p>

<p>This last, in undertone; then louder: “She is
Northern born, too, I think you said?”</p>

<p>“Who, ma’am, the girl? O yes; we’re from
the North.”</p>

<p>It was the man’s turn to sigh now. “We
come down here to try the climate for her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
mother—but it didn’t do; we came too late, or
something. The mother died the very next
summer, and we’ve had to pull along alone.
There, ma’am, I think that buckle is all right
now; it won’t come out again of itself in a hurry.
It’s lucky I happened to be around; it might
have made you trouble. Why, no, ma’am, I
don’t want no <i>pay</i> for a job like that; it didn’t
take ten minutes, and it ain’t in my line anyhow.”</p>

<p>“What can she do when she is well?” asked
Mrs. Hammond, holding out the shining silver.</p>

<p>“What, my girl? Why, as to that, I dunno
as she can be said to know how to do anything.
She works along as well as she can; and we make
out to live, but you see it is pretty nigh four
years since her mother died; and she was a
young thing then. She ain’t had no chance. I
ain’t got no change, Mis’ Hammond, and I don’t
want no pay, neither.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want change, Mr. West; it is worth
a dollar to me to know that all the buckles and
straps are in order. I shall leave that matter of
hauling the dirt in your hands, then. It can be
done just as well while I am away; Mr. Hart will
be back and forth, I presume, and he can direct
you if you need any directions; good-morning!”
And the little pony phaeton drove away.</p>

<p>As the fat little white pony carefully drew the
carriage around the curve, his mistress heard a
weak, petulant voice say: “O father, it is <i>so</i> hot;
I don’t know what to do.”</p>

<p>“Poor thing!” said Mrs. Hammond for the
third time, “I don’t know what she will do. It
<i>is</i> very warm indeed. She thinks Monteagle
sounds like Heaven. I presume it would seem
almost like Heaven to her. If there was anything
she could do”—and then Mrs. Hammond
looked at her watch, and spoke sharply to the
fat pony, and they went to the house at a brisk trot.</p>

<p>It was a lovely home. Before even the pony
turned in at the tree-lined carriage drive which
wound quite around the house, you would have
known by the air of quiet elegance which hung
gracefully over everything in sight, that you
were coming to a home that commanded money
and culture. In the wide handsome hall everything
was in order, and the rooms opening from
them were cool, and dark, and elegant. Yet
Mrs. Hammond as she dropped sun hat and umbrella
on a white sofa, and trailed her white
morning shawl over the soft carpet toward an
easy chair, said: “O dear! it is warm <i>everywhere</i>.
I wish we were on the mountain this
minute.” Even as she spoke, she thought of
that hollow-eyed West girl again. When, after a
few minutes of rest, she mounted the long winding
flight of stairs to the nursery, the sight which
met her eyes was not calculated to cool her.</p>

<p>Miss Ethel Hammond was on an investigating
tour. At this particular minute she belonged in
a wide white crib rolled into the coolest, shadiest
corner of the northwestern veranda, eyes closed,
lovely face shaded from intruding bugs and flies
by a network of delicate creamy lace, and Jennette,
the nurse, within easy range of the treasure.
Where Jennette was just now, was not
apparent, but Miss Ethel was certainly not in
her crib. Her eyes were very wide open, and
she had the room to herself.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 580px;">
<img src="images/i-012.jpg" width="580" height="504" alt="toddler looking at clock" />
<div class="caption">BABY ETHEL.</div>
</div>

<p>By dint of much energy, she had succeeded in
pulling one of the heavy chairs before the object
of her most intense desire, and, climbing in, was
in the act of leaning forward to grasp it, when
Mrs. Hammond opened the door. “It” was a
rare and wonderfully mounted clock, heavy
enough to put Ethel’s busy inquiring brain at
rest forever, should the strong little hands succeed
in pulling it over on her; or, failing in that,
should she lose her balance and pitch head-first
against the corner of the cruel marble.</p>

<p>No time for exclamations; rather, enough
presence of mind to avoid them. With swift,
silent steps she moved across the room; a long
room, and seeming to the startled mother
miles long, just then. A moment more and she
had the wide-awake, energetic, struggling, disappointed
baby in her arms. So near to its life-purpose
only to be thwarted!</p>

<p>The first thing the mother did, was to kiss
Ethel; though her mouth was wide open, and
from it were issuing loud, disappointed yells.</p>

<p>The next thing was to think aloud: “That is
as much confidence as I was afraid I could place
in Jennette. She is good for ruffling, and tucking,
and ironing the baby’s dresses, but not for
watching her.”</p>

<p>The next was to say within her heart, “I
should think <i>she</i> might be able to help keep a
baby out of mischief.”</p>

<p>But this last thought was not about Jennette.</p>

<h2>SOME REMARKABLE WOMEN.</h2>

<h3>S.—SMITH, MRS. HANNAH WHITALL.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-b.jpg" width="49" height="113" alt="B"/>
</div>

<p class="drop-capi2">BORN and reared in a Quaker home, educated
in a Quaker school, and for many
years holding her membership in the sect
known by that name, Mrs. Smith has
been characterized as “a Friend indeed.”
Of her father and herself, this has been said:
“He was a bright, cheery, joyous, yet Cromwellian
soldier, clapped by mistake under the broad
brim of a Quaker, but this extinguisher was never
able to hide his gladsome piety, and the daughter
is her father over again.”</p>

<p>Her husband is a partner in the firm of Whitall,
Tatum &amp; Co. And just here I want to tell you
something which I learned the other day regarding
the temperance principles of this firm. Their
business is the manufacture of white glass; theirs
being the largest establishment of the kind in the
world. So consistent and loyal to the cause of
temperance are these men, that no orders for glass
ware are accepted from men who will use the
bottles and glasses for rum in any of its guises!</p>

<p>Doubtless they sometimes lose money by refusing
large orders, but it is a fact that it sometimes
costs something to be consistent. Nevertheless,
let us be consistent—it pays in the long
run! Mrs. Smith is well known to the world of
Christians as H. W. S. You may have seen in
your mother’s workbasket, or found slipped between
the leaves of her Bible or other favorite
book of devotion, little tracts bearing this signature.</p>

<p>She has for many years been accustomed to
give expositions of Scriptures, sometimes going
to obscure country churches of a Sabbath evening,
then again speaking to thousands gathered
in an immense hall in London. Of her powers
as a public speaker, an English paper says:
“Her freshness, her profound insight, are as remarkable
as her surprising fluency.”</p>

<p>I think it was in a little paper called <i>Times
of Refreshing</i>, that an article appeared which
described the effect of her addresses upon an
audience as something remarkable. Saying that,
however old and worn the topic, she by her vigorous
way of presenting the truth seemed to
make it over new, and the secret of her power
is given in five words: “consecrated talent and
careful research.”</p>

<p>One of her children says of her: “She seems
to me perfectly unselfish, and this she carries
into the smallest details.” Of how many of us
can this be said, I wonder!</p>

<p>Speaking of the sorrows and the bereavements
which Mrs. Smith has been called to bear, Miss
Willard says: “To the praise of that dear name
above all others, let it be said, this Christian
heart knows, proves, illustrates, always, in all
life’s changeful discipline, the victory that overcometh
even faith. No sentence is so familiar
to her friends from those dear smiling lips that
open but to speak brave and tender words, as
‘I cannot be unhappy, for I always have God.’”</p>

<p>Mrs. Smith is also known to the world as the
Superintendent of the Evangelistic Department
of the W. C. T. U. Does that need explanation?
You all know what sort of an organization
the W. C. T. U. is. Well, one of the first
questions which came to the noble Christians
who banded themselves together to fight the
monster vice of intemperance was this puzzling
one, How shall we reach the masses? Men
bound by the chains of the drink habit were not
likely to come voluntarily within their influence.
Then there was but one answer to the question:
“Go to them!” And they went, and it is this
work of carrying the Gospel story to the poor
drunkard, that we call evangelistic work. Mrs.
Smith tells us how she became identified with
the W. C. T. U. At the time of the Crusade
she was in England, engaged in her work of
Bible exposition, but when she heard through
the newspapers of the wonderful outpouring of
God’s spirit upon her countrywomen, her soul
was stirred, and she seemed to hear the voice of
her Master calling upon her for a consecration to
the work, and she says, “sitting before an English
fire in our London house, I joined that
Crusade.”</p>

<p>She said: “Those women are my sisters, and
their work is my work from this time forward
until my death.” Again she says: “I consider
the W. C. T. U. one of the grandest instrumentalities
for good the world has ever known.”</p>

<p>Can you tell why I have selected Mrs. Hannah
Whitall Smith to stand in this list of Remarkable
Women?</p>

<h2>OUR ALPHABET OF GREAT MEN.</h2>

<h3>V.—VINCENT, REV. JOHN H., D. D.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="splittop" src="images/drop-ia.jpg" alt="I" width="72" height="25" />
  <img class="split" src="images/drop-ib.jpg" alt="drop I" width="53" height="70" />
</div>

<p class="dropcapstory">I &nbsp; HAVE written down the name of the
“great man” which I have chosen to
stand in this Alphabet, and here I pause as
I reflect that to many of you his face and
form and speech are familiar. You have seen him
upon the platform and upon the avenues of Chautauqua
and Framingham, and in other places.
Some of you have welcomed him at your own
homes; his smiles and his talks are among the
things which will be always, so long as you live, a
pleasant memory. What can I tell you about him
that you do not already know? Yet I am not
willing that another name should take the place
of this, and therefore we will talk a little together
of this friend of the young people, and
idol of the older people.</p>

<p>Dr. Vincent’s early home was in the Sunny
South. “In the land of orange blossoms and
magnolia groves,” he first saw the light. Six
years of his life were spent in the home of the
flowers; then the family came North and settled
in Pennsylvania. Like the mothers of many of
our great men, John H. Vincent’s mother might
fill a worthy place in our list of Remarkable
Women.</p>

<p>She is described as “patient, amiable, living
as though she belonged to heaven rather than
earth. Often at the twilight hour, especially
on Sundays, she would take her children to her
own room, and there sweetly and tenderly tell
them about the life to come, and point out their
faults and spiritual needs.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bolton in her sketch of Dr. Vincent published
two or three years since, gives some
amusing incidents of the childhood of our Great
Man. I quote from memory, but I think it is
she who tells the story of the boy of six years
gathering the children of the neighborhood, and
after getting them quiet by threatening them
with the lash of a whip, he would preach to
them. And so far did his zeal carry him, that
upon one occasion he tore into several parts a
small red-covered hymn book, which he valued
as the gift of his pastor, and distributed the
pieces through his audience, doubtless thinking
it highly important that all should be supplied
with hymn books. Whether they all sang together
from the different parts of the book given
them, we are not informed.</p>

<p>Very early in life the boy seems to have decided
that he would <i>do something with his life
worth while</i>; that he would do that which should
help others, and realizing that there is a world
to be saved, he grew up with the hope of one
day becoming a minister. His studies were carried
on for a time at home, afterwards at a
neighboring academy. Later he engaged in
teaching, continuing his studies by himself, and
finally he had fitted himself for college. Not
every boy would have the will and perseverance
to carry on a course of study while teaching six
hours or more each day. However, he did not
finish his college course. Not for any want of
persistence, neither did he consider such a course
unimportant. But he was anxious to be about
his Master’s work, and thus it was that before he
was twenty-one years old he set out to preach
“on a thirty-mile circuit, over the mountains and
through the valleys of Luzerne County, Pennsylvania.”</p>

<p>He travelled on horseback, studying and thinking
out his sermons as he journeyed. Everybody,
young and old, were glad to see his bright, smiling
face and feel the warm grasp of his hand. It
has been said that “he never shook hands with
the tips of his fingers, nor preached dry sermons.”</p>

<p>It was during this period of his life that his
mother whose parting words when he went out
into the world were, “My son, live near to God;
live near to God,” went to be with God. One
near the throne in heaven, the other living near
the throne on earth; is this the secret of John
H. Vincent’s success in the Lord’s vineyard?</p>

<p>At length he became a pastor, preaching for a
few years in New Jersey, afterwards in the vicinity
of Chicago. But all the time he was busy
with plans of an educational character. These
plans which were at first carried out in the establishing
of Saturday afternoon classes of young
people, called Palestine Classes, with the purpose
of studying about the Holy Land, have at length
developed a Chautauqua. I need not tell you
about Chautauqua; about the C. L. S. C., nor
about the C. Y. F. R. U.; you do not need
to be told about the town and country clubs, nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
about the society of Christian ethics. Many of
you have listened to those Sunday afternoon
talks in the Children’s Temple, and afterwards
gone to the vesper service in the Hall of Philosophy.</p>

<p>I ought to tell you that although Dr. Vincent
postponed his college course, he never gave it up,
but outside college walls, he continued his studies
by himself, even in the midst of a busy life,
until by regular examinations he took his degrees,
and also passed through the regular theological
course of study of the Methodist Episcopal
Church, to which denomination he belongs.</p>

<p>To the boys especially I recommend the study
of the life and character of Dr. Vincent. A
gentleman remarked in my hearing the other
day, “probably no man living is exerting a wider
influence over the hearts and minds of the young
people than Dr. Vincent!” And I thought, what
a responsibility! and how thankful the fathers
and mothers should be that he is just the man
he is; that his influence is ever on the side of
truth and right; that his aim is to uplift, and
that Christ is ever the centre of his thought.
To see and hear Dr. Vincent is to understand
something of the secret of his power. The sympathy
which manifests itself in every look and
tone, the enthusiasm with which he enters into
his work, and which tides him over the hard
places, and the personal magnetism—which
makes you, whether you will or not; these qualities,
sanctified and consecrated, make the man a
power for good.</p>

<h2>THE LITTLE RED SHOP.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Margaret Sidney.</span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-t.jpg" width="59" height="112" alt="T"/>
</div>

<p class="drop-capi2">THE old house on Cherryfield high road,
back of the row of stiff poplars, with
its queer little gnarled apple-trees at
the back, looked for all the world just
as it did one hundred years ago. It
had no more paint on it now than when the
children’s grandfather took home his young
bride who thought it the most beautiful place in
all the world to begin housekeeping in. Then
it was a dingy yellow, with faded green blinds;
and now the same forlorn attempt at coloring
greeted all passers-by. To be sure it had been
painted many times in the interim, but always
the same hue was chosen, so that to the oldest
inhabitant it was the best known landmark for
miles around.</p>

<p>The “Brimmer Place” was known too, for
something else than its antiquity; it was the
cheeriest, home-iest old house that ever stood on
any road, overflowing with good-will to everybody,
especially to sick people and to little children.
If anybody were in trouble and could
reach her, Mrs. Brimmer always found just the
right word of cheer to speak, while she tried to
help in many other ways—and what she didn’t
do, why, there were Jack, and Cornelius, and
Rosalie, to say nothing of Primrose, the baby—four
little comforters who made everybody just
happy to look at them. And yet every one who
lived in the big, hundred-year-old house was poor.</p>

<p>“It’s most dreadful to be poor,” said Rosalie
one morning, in a burst of confidence to the
boys, out in the woodshed. Cornelius stopped
hacking at an old log to flash her a convincing
“no” out of his black eyes.</p>

<p>“And it’s so very unagreeable,” continued
Rosalie, smoothing down her apron while she
seated herself on one end of the bench.</p>

<p>“<i>Dis</i>agreeable, you mean,” corrected Jack,
picking up sticks over in the corner. “There,
Corny, you let that old fellow alone; I’ll tackle
him soon. He’s too tough for you.”</p>

<p>Corny, resenting the implication, let the hatchet
fly on the back of the old log to show how strong
he was in such a masterful style that the chips
flew in every direction, and Rosalie paused to
shake them from her apron, before she said,</p>

<p>“No; I’m quite sure it is unagreeable—I
saw it in the dictionary.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, you didn’t see right,” said Jack.
“It’s d-i-s; awful big letters too. Means hateful,
and not nice.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s not nice to be poor,” said Rosalie
wisely waiving all further discussion as to the
word; “that you must say anyway, Jack.”</p>

<p>But Jack’s lips were tight. Presently he
straightened himself up, and gave his head a
shake. “Well, what shall we do about it?”</p>

<p>“Do?” said Rosalie, in surprise, “why, I
don’t know what you mean, Jack?”</p>

<p>“When things are not nice, there is no use in
talking about them if you don’t do something to
make them better,” said Jack philosophically.
“Now I want to know what we are going to do
to make ourselves rich.”</p>

<p>“<i>To make ourselves rich—O Jack!</i>” cried
Rosalie and Cornelius together.</p>

<p>“If we can earn some money, I suppose we
shall be rich sometime,” observed Jack; “everybody
was poor once, but they worked and got
money. Now, how can we?”</p>

<p>The children were so possessed with the idea
of their ever being rich, that no words came to
their aid; and Jack went on without interruption.</p>

<p>“I’ve been thinking over something that, if
we can do it, will be perfectly splendid, and help
mammy take care of baby. Poor, dear mammy!”</p>

<p>He turned away for a moment, and then
showed his face again, the same old Jack with
the laughing eyes, and pleasant, honest mouth.</p>

<p>“Tell on,” said Cornelius, who had dropped
his hatchet, and drawn near. “Be quick and
tell us,” he added breathlessly.</p>

<p>“Well, there is the tool-house,” said Jack.
“Funny old hole, but just the thing for us.
Now what’s to hinder our setting up a shop in
it, and selling things?”</p>

<p>“Real true-as-you-live things,” cried Rosalie,
“with counters, string, and brown paper bags?”
“And five cent pieces, and cents and quarters?”
screamed Cornelius on his highest key.
“Whickets! why didn’t we think of it before?
But where’d we get the things to sell with?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Phoh! your news isn’t anything, after all; only
just an old dried-up joke.” He was so disgusted,
that he went back, picked up his hatchet, and fell
to slowly hacking again. Jack flung himself up
to Rosalie’s side on the bench.</p>

<p>“Now see here, both of you. The thing can
be done, if we will all club together, and work
hard. It’s not to be a success in a day, mind
you, but we’ve got to pull hard, and at it all the
time. Are you willing to do it for mammy’s
sake?”</p>

<p>“Can’t we have any time for play?” asked
Rosalie with a long face.</p>

<p>“Perhaps; but there won’t be much,” said
Jack, “if we make a good thing of this.”</p>

<p>“Well, I s’pose you and I are the men of this
family,” said Cornelius, over his log, “and so if
you’ll just say how the money’s coming to begin
with, why, I’ll give you my word, I’ll keep at it.”</p>

<p>“We want Rosalie,” said Jack, kindly; “we
can’t do anything without her.”</p>

<p>“Why, she’s nothing but a girl,” said Cornelius,
still pummeling; “it takes men to keep
store and make money.”</p>

<p>“But there are ever so many things that a
girl can do to help us,” said Jack, “so we must
take her into partnership.”</p>

<p>“O Jack! how very fine and exquisite,” cried
Rosalie, grasping his arm with excited little fingers.
“I’ll wait on customers, and make change
all alone, and help you fix up things and look
nice.”</p>

<p>“She uses such terribly big words,” said Cornelius,
in disfavor at the scheme, “and puts on
airs, just like all the other girls. Jack, we can’t
let her in; it’s no use to try.”</p>

<p>“Now, Corny,” cried Rosalie, slipping from
her bench and standing quite tall. “I’m very
big—nearly ten; and I know a great many
things, and Jack says I may—so there.”</p>

<p>“Yes, she really ought,” said Jack, with a nod
over at the smaller boy, “because you see it’s a
family concern. We must make it Brimmer
Brothers and Company.”</p>

<p>“Am I Company?” asked Rosalie, in subdued
excitement.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Jack. “Well, now I’ll tell you
how we can make the money to buy the things
that we are to sell. To begin with, Rosalie?”</p>

<p>“I?” cried the Company, with widened eyes.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Jack nodded at her very decidedly.
“You can take care of Mrs. Prouty’s baby.”</p>

<p>“O Jack!” It was a tone of horror that came
from the girl of the family, “you don’t ever
mean that?”</p>

<p>“If we are really going to earn money to help
mammy with, we must expect to do some disagreeable
work,” said Jack gravely.</p>

<p>Rosalie hid her ashamed little face a moment,
then said, “Very well, I’ll do it. But how do
you know she wants me?”</p>

<p>“I heard her tell the cook when I carried the
lettuce there this morning that she’d give fifty
cents to any girl who would take care of the
baby a week—just come in every day. Her
cousin is going there to-morrow to visit, and she
wants her time to herself. Just think, Rosalie,
fifty bright new cents!”</p>

<p>The Company fairly clapped her hands. “Perhaps
she’ll let me bring the baby over home,
then I sha’n’t be away from Primrose.”</p>

<p>“She’d be only too glad to get him out of
the way, I’ll be bound,” said Jack; “I sh’d be,
if I owned that baby.”</p>

<p>“And Primrose is so sweet that any other
baby would smile and be good, even if it was a
great fat, big, crying, red-faced one like Mrs.
Prouty’s,” said Rosalie, seeing some alleviation
to her task of earning fifty cents. “Now what
is Corny going to do?” she demanded, trying
not to hope that his work was disagreeable also.</p>

<p>“Corny and I have to work together,” said
Jack, with a little grimace he couldn’t help.
“It’s to clean up Widow Brown’s pig-pen.”</p>

<p>“I sha’n’t clean up that old woman’s pig-pen,
nor anybody’s pig-pen,” shouted Corny, with a
vicious hack at the log; “no, <i>sir</i>!”</p>

<p>“Very well, sir,” cried Jack back again,
“then I’ll do it alone.”</p>

<p>He didn’t say, “I would if I were you,” or
anything of the persuasive sort, knowing that by
no such ways could he manage Cornelius. He
simply let him alone, as he always did, and did
his own duty. The consequence was, the chubby
young wood-chopper presently turned around,
and said complacently, “When I get this log
chipped up for mammy, I’ll join you.”</p>

<p>“If you don’t come till that log is done, I’ll
have Widow Brown’s pig-pen in apple pie
order,” cried Jack, in high good humor.</p>

<p class="dropcapstory">GRETCHEN VAN CORTLANDT was a
little German <i>mädchen</i>, as you see by
her name, and she lived in the great
city of Berlin. She and her mother occupied
two rooms in a tenement house on “Steinstrasse,”
as her father had died when she was
very young. Gretchen had very few play-things,
and spent much of the time in helping
her mother earn what little money she could.</p>

<p>One Sunday Gretchen went out for a walk,
and while going along the crowded street,
reached a large brick building, from which came
the sound of singing. Above the door there
was a sign which she spelled out, and found
to be, “<i>Wilkommen!</i>” As that meant “Welcome!”
to a little German girl, Gretchen hesitated,
and finally pushed open the door, and
walked in. It was a large room, with seats full
of people, many of whom were poorly and even
raggedly dressed. At one end was a desk, and
behind it stood a man who was reading something
out of a big book.</p>

<p>“Even Christ pleased not Himself.”</p>

<p>“My!” thought Gretchen, “I wonder why!”
But the man was talking. There was a good
deal he said that the little girl could not understand,
but she found that there was once a very
good Prince, the son of a good and great King,
who had come from his palace and had gone
around, through a great deal of trouble, trying
to save people from harm. He did nothing to
please only Himself, but wanted to please his
Father and those who loved Him. Gretchen understood
one other thing—that every one else
could do as this Prince did, and help other people
as He had done, because He loved them so.
If they did this they would be pleasing Him.</p>

<p>So when she reached home, Gretchen told her
mother what she had heard, and asked her to explain
it.</p>

<p>“Truly, child,” said the Frau Van Cortlandt,
“I remember very little that I used to hear about
it, but it’s all true—what he said.”</p>

<p>“But, mother, how can we all, or a poor little
<i>mädchen</i> like me, please this great Prince?”
asked Gretchen.</p>

<p>“Ach, child!” said the good Frau, “I remember
very little about it, but this I know—that
every little boy and girl in the Fatherland, no
matter how poor or small they are, can please this
Prince, and the King, His Father, by doing something
good and kind.”</p>

<p>“I should like to do something for Him,
mother, if He is as good as the man said,” replied
Gretchen.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That is the first part of the story. The next
part came nearly a week later, when there was
to be a great procession through the city. There
were proclamations all over the city, saying that
the “Kaiser Wilhelm,” their emperor, was to
march through the streets, with his soldiers and
guards in full uniform, and the drums were to
beat, and the bugles were to blow, and the houses
were to be decorated with flags, in honor of the
procession.</p>

<p>Our little <i>mädchen</i> was, of course, in a flutter
of delight about it, especially when she found
they were to march down their street, and past
their tenement-house, on the way to the Königstrasse.
How delightful! She would see the
great army of Germany, and the great Kaiser
William, march by their door!</p>

<p>When the eventful morning came, everything
was bright and gay-looking, and the sidewalks
were crowded with people who wished to see the
procession. When the Van Cortlandts’ bed had
been made, the breakfast dishes cleared away, and
the two rooms nicely swept and dusted (for it is
to be believed that if the Frau Van Cortlandt
had known the end of the world was to come in
an hour, she would not have delayed her morning’s
work a moment) Gretchen and her mother
were ready to watch and wait, with the remainder
of the city. But alas, and alas. No
view was to be had from their windows, because
of the crowd outside, and no room could be found
outside. No one would give up their place.
How much Gretchen wished for the Herr Van
Breyck, their only friend, who would take her
in his strong arms, and find a place for her, but
he was away at Frankfort, and what should she
do?</p>

<p>Suddenly she thought of the attic balcony!
It was a little bit of a one, and would hold but
one person. Gretchen’s mother could not go up
the stairs, so she slipped up to the unoccupied
garret, and out on the balcony, from which she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
could look down over the heads of the people,
and see the Emperor and his troops, as nicely as
she could wish.</p>

<p>She was leaning lazily over the edge of the
balcony when she chanced to
see, in the middle of the road,
a poor old woman, who was
vainly trying to get a good
place amid the crowd. Among
those people there was little
chance for her, and Gretchen
pitied her.</p>

<div class="caption">BERLIN: STATUE OF FREDERIC THE GREAT.</div>
</div>

<p>“Poor thing!” she said.
“I think”—at this moment
she suddenly stopped, startled
by a thought which came into
her mind, and remained silent
quite a while. What she was
thinking was something like
this: “Suppose I should ask
her to come up on the balcony?
Then I couldn’t see
the procession at all—and
that wouldn’t do, after all my
trouble to get a good place.
I wonder if that would be
doing what the man said—not
pleasing myself? Maybe
it would, but then it is such a
little thing that I’m sure the
King wouldn’t hear of it. If
I could only please Him some
<i>great</i> way, how nice it would
be!”</p>

<p>But I am glad to tell you,
and am sure you will be glad
to hear, that after this talk
with herself, the little girl
made her way down to where
the old lady was looking about
her.</p>

<p>“Good Frau,” she said, as
the old lady turned to look
at her, “I have a place for you
to see the procession; will you come with me?”</p>

<p>Through the door, up the three flights of
stairs, went the little light figure, followed by
the older and feeble one. “I am afraid, good
Frau, these stairs will tire you,” said Gretchen,
“but it is the only place there is.”</p>

<p>A chair was then brought up from the Frau
Van Cortlandt’s own kitchen, on which the old
lady seated herself, after which Gretchen went
to the bedroom down-stairs, and throwing herself
on the bed, burst into a flood of tears. “I
can’t help it,” she sobbed; “I did so want to see
the procession! But I am not sorry, if the
Prince knows.” Then she dried her eyes and
went to the door, where she could see nothing
but the backs of the people in front of it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>The Ellsworths had been in Berlin some weeks,
and having seen all they wanted to of the city,
were about ready to go back to America, but
they stayed longer than they otherwise would
have done, for the purpose of seeing the procession.
And then, as Amelia said, “it was just
perfectly horrid,” that, after all, the soldiers were
not to pass in front of their hotel.</p>

<p>“I am determined to see the procession,” said
Mrs. Ellsworth. “And so am I,” said Amelia.
Nevertheless, they were acquainted with no one
in Berlin who would offer them a place, and
they couldn’t well stand in the streets, “with
the rabble,” said Mrs. Ellsworth.</p>

<p>“Blees, your honors,” said Hans, their guide
and interpreter, “I haf zomedings teu zay.
Mein schwester hab ein house in der Steinstrasse,
mit ein gut—vat you gall it—palgonie, vair
you kon go, if blees you.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go, mother!” said Amelia, “anything
is better than not seeing the procession, when we
stayed in the city on purpose.”</p>

<p>And Hans, not in the least minding the doubtful
compliment to his “schwester’s house,” agreed
to drive them around there early enough to keep
out of the crowd. So it came to pass that on
the balcony of the Frau Krant’s house, across
the street from the Frau Van Cortlandt’s, were
seated, the morning of the procession, Mrs. Ellsworth,
her daughter Amelia, and her sister Julia.</p>

<p>“Mamma,” said Amelia, “look at that cute little
German girl across the street up on that mite
of a balcony. See! she has gone down now.”</p>

<p>Sometime later, she had more remarks to make.
“Mamma, that little girl went down and got a
poor old woman to take her place on the balcony—see
her up there—and she is down now
where she can’t see a thing.”</p>

<p>“Is it possible!” said Mrs. Ellsworth; “that
is an act of self-denial one doesn’t often see in a
child. Are you sure she hasn’t a better place?”</p>

<p>“Yes, mamma, there she is, down by the door,
where she can’t see anything, I know.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said Mrs. Ellsworth, “I am going to
have her come up here. There is room between
Julia and me. Hans!” and that individual,
who had been talking with his “schwester” inside,
appeared. “Tell that little German girl
in the door across the road, that I would like to
see her up here.”</p>

<p>“Mamma!” said Amelia.</p>

<p>“Ja!” said Hans, in his surprise returning
to the use of his native tongue.</p>

<p>“She looks very neat and nice, Amelia,” said
Mrs. Ellsworth.</p>

<p>So it happened that our heroine Gretchen was
confronted by a dignified-looking personage of
her race, who informed her that a Frau from
America desired her presence in the balcony
across the street. Gretchen was frightened, and
vaguely wondered if she had in any way committed
treason against the United States Government,
but her trembling limbs carried her to
the Frau Krant’s balcony, where Mrs. Ellsworth
questioned her, through her interpreter.</p>

<p>The story all came out, in German and in English,
how Gretchen had given up her place because
of the King and his Son, whom she wanted
to please. Said she, “I am only a little <i>mädchen</i>,
but I thought He might know.”</p>

<p>By this time there came the sound of drum
and fife and martial footsteps, from around the
corner, and the eyes of all on Steinstrasse were
turned toward the place whence the sound proceeded.
Mrs. Ellsworth desired Hans to tell the
little girl she could stay where she was until the
procession passed, thus relieving her fears that
she was to be arrested for treason, and she, in
turn, committed her overwhelming thanks to
the good Frau for a good place to stand.</p>

<p>That isn’t the end, though I am almost through.
Gretchen says she would have been satisfied
without a place on the balcony, or anything else,
if she could have known that she pleased the
King and his Son by not pleasing herself, but
that didn’t hinder her being very thankful that
she could see the Emperor and his troops, and
Mrs. Ellsworth made up her mind that she wanted
a nice little German girl to take home to America,
and educate and help in various ways, in return
for her services, and a nice German woman who
could do her washing, and live with her, too.</p>

<p>So the week after the procession found the Frau
Van Cortlandt and her daughter bidding the Herr
Van Breyck good-by, as they boarded the steamer
bound for America, at the Hamburg wharves.</p>

<p>Gretchen and her mother are still living with
the Ellsworths, and though they are sometimes
a little homesick for the “Fatherland,” they are
enjoying their home in America very much.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>The week after they reached home they ate
the Thanksgiving dinner, with a huge turkey and
its regular belongings, and though they had never
been used to the day at home, Gretchen and her
mother were as thankful, they thought, as anyone
could have been. And the way to be happy and
thankful as they would tell you, is to try to
make others so. “And it all came about,” said
Mrs. Ellsworth, “because of that kind and unselfish
act of yours, Gretchen.”</p>

<p>“I am only a little <i>mädchen</i>,” said Gretchen,
“but I pleased not myself, and the King saw.”</p>

<h2>CELEBRATED TREES.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap">THE chestnut-tree at Mt. Etna, is one hundred
and ninety-six feet in circumference,
and its branches are like trees. For ages have
pilgrims delighted to linger in its shadows.
There is also a great chestnut-tree at Tamworth,
England, and when Stephen was king, in 1135,
it formed a boundary, called the “Great Chestnut-Tree.”
I have also heard of one called the
“Manna Tree;” they grow in Italy and Sicily.
The bark of it is cut in August, and the manna
flows out like water. It was used for medicine.
It is unlike the manna mentioned in the Bible,
called “Bread of Heaven,” upon which the
Children of Israel were fed. That was a small
grain, and fell early in the morning. It was
made into paste, and baked.</p>

<p>The Bamboo is used mostly in making houses,
in Sumatra, and when the great and good Dr.
Judson was a missionary, his lovely wife, Anne
Hasseltine, made themselves a bamboo cottage.</p>

<p>The India Rubber tree is also very useful.
It grows in South America and India. In Quito
it is made into cloth.</p>

<p>The Cocoa-tree gives the poor Indians bread,
water, milk, honey, oil, sugar, needles, clothes,
thread, cups, baskets, cordage, nails, roofs, etc.</p>

<p>The Bread-Tree of the Pacific Islands yields
fruit for eight months of the year. Two or
three trees will supply one person with sufficient
food. It is very nourishing.</p>

<p>The Jaca resembles this tree; it grows in Asia.
The fruit often weighs thirty pounds. When
the tree is young it grows upon the twigs, later,
on the trunk, when old, upon the roots.</p>

<h3>LIKES AND DISLIKES.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">THIS is a splendid game if well played.
Form two lines, each facing the other. A
leader goes down the centre asking the right-hand
line, beginning at the head, “What do
you like best?” Each one must answer just
what he or she wishes to, funny objects of course
adding to the jollity of the game. When Leader
has finished, she turns around and goes up the
centre, asking the left hand line, “What do
you dislike most?” When all have answered,
she claps her hands, and cries, “Now.” The
two lines pass across each other, turn, and pass
back again, turn to their original places, facing
each other, when they remain still. As the lines
are crossing, each player must sing “I love
cheese,” or whatever he or she has professed to
like, or, “I dislike cats,” or whatever he or she
has professed to dislike, keeping distinct and
clear, each his own utterance; <i>no one must smile</i>.
After this is over, the leader must pass down
and up the line, asking one side, “Why do you
like it?” or, “Why do you dislike it?” Then
the lines pass across, singing, “Because it is delightful,”
or, “Because it is squealing,” or anything—turn,
dance back again to places. The
leader must then pass down and up the centre,
asking each line, “What are you going to do
with it?” When all have answered, the lines
must pass across, singing their answers, turn, and
pass back again, ending with each player singing
“I like monkeys because they are funny, I’ll send
them to school;” or, “I dislike pigs because they
are squealing; I’ll cut off their heads;” or anything
they choose. Pass across, turn, and pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
back again, when two opposite players take hold
of hands, beginning at top, pass down centre, bow
to each other, and go off to their seat, continuing
till all are seated. Whoever smiles during this
game must be conducted out of the line and
made to stand up against the side of the room,
with their faces to the wall, where they must
remain as wall-flowers till the game is finished.</p>

<p>P. S. This game is so long, we could only
print one this month. Send on the games, Pansies,
as soon as you can, that you wish to have
printed in this department.</p>

who has just shut the door on you all? Three
hundred and sixty-five days since last November!
Oh! the story of them. How ill it reads
when you come to look it over! Oh! there is
ever so much which you wish was blotted out?
Is that what you say? I know, for I have to
say the same. What a blessed thing for us all
that we have a Friend, great and glorious, who
has promised to do just that with the story of
our mistakes and failures. “I will blot out
their transgressions.” Have you been to Him
to get them blotted out?</p>

<p>Well, we begin again. New faces join us;
and we must do what we can to help them.
They will do what they can to help us. A
Thanksgiving Day is just ahead. Shall we
each try to give some one something for which
to be thankful? It may be that they need only
a pleasant word, a loving smile, a kind “Good-morning!”
Such easy things to give! Shall
we look about us while the surly November
winds blow over half the country, and the balmy
November breezes glide over the other half,
and whether Dame Nature smiles or frowns
where we are, make all hearts light because of
our brightness, and sympathy, and unselfishness?
Try to spread sunshine, my Blossoms, so we
may have real flowers all the year round.</p>

<p>What are we going to give you for 1887?
Why, look through the November <span class="smcap">Pansy</span> and
see. “Monteagle.” Yes; that is a serial. I
shall tell how it all happened, just as well as I
can. I do hope you will like some of the people,
for I do, very much. “She.” I know it
is a queer title. It will be altogether a queer
story. Something that happened, well known
to seven different people, who intend to tell it
as well as each of them know how. Who are
the people? Why, their names will be at the
head of the chapters which they write. You
can see for yourselves. “All Along the Line.”
I know you will like our new department.
Young people always like to know what is really
going on in this world; and of course you will
enjoy the design, engraved especially for us,
by an artist who is also one of our contributors,
and who loves every Blossom of you. For the
rest, the old friends, Faye Huntington, Rev. C.
M. Livingston, Margaret Sidney, Paranete, etc.,
will continue to work for you; you have told
me so many times that you thought they were
“Just perfectly splendid,” and as they each intend
to be more splendid than ever, this year, I
have no fears for their places in your hearts.</p>

<p>There are other new features, which you will
be able to see for yourselves. We mean, with
your help, to make <span class="smcap">The Pansy</span> for 1887 a great
deal better than ever before. How many new
Blossoms can you gather for our bed?</p>

<p>Another thing; will you remember that you
have now a department of your own to look
after? “Around the Family Lamp” has been
thrown open for your use. We do hope you
will be industrious and unselfish, and send on
your thoughts as often as you have any. Keep
your eyes open, and when you see other people<span class="pagenum"><a name="editors_2" id="editors_2">[2]</a></span>
playing games which you think are pleasant,
don’t be contented with simply copying their
good times, but pass the word down the line for
the rest of us.</p>

<p>That reminds me of the address: I wonder if
there is any way in which I can get you to remember
it? Winter Park, Orange Co., Florida.
This, until further notice. Now please do not
send your letters to Boston, nor to Cincinnati,
nor to Chautauqua, nor anywhere else but to
Winter Park. Understand? Of course when
you want to subscribe for <span class="smcap">The Pansy</span>, or order
books, or transact any business which would
naturally belong to the Publishers, you send to
Boston, as usual. But for the “P. S. Department,”
or “Around the Family Lamp,” or when
you want a badge, or want to ask me any question,
remember the Winter Park address. For
anything pertaining to the new department,
“All Along the Line,” address the Editor, R. M.
Alden, at Winter Park, also. Who will be the
first to give us some games for our Christmas
number?</p>

<p><i>Gracie</i> from Canada. Indeed, your letter
was not too long. I enjoyed every word. You
must have been a very industrious Pansy to get
so many premiums. I knew a boy who used to
trouble his mother very much by being late to
breakfast. One morning when he came down
to the dining-room half an hour after time, he
found the table dishes all cleared away, and
there was no breakfast for that boy until next
morning. I don’t think he was late again for
nearly two weeks. I am glad you are going to
break yourself of that careless habit without
any such help.</p>

<p><i>Mary Edith</i> from Ohio. It is very easy to
be cross, and brave to try to overcome the habit.
I hope your badge will help you.</p>

<p><i>Ray Spencer</i> from Turkey in Asia. We are
very glad to welcome you. One who “tries to
do things right the first time,” is a great comfort
to his friends, and will be likely to grow
into a good and wise man. It is a pleasure to
have a letter from your far-away home. The
Pansies would all be glad to hear something
about the people of Turkey. Can’t you write
us a little letter for the magazine?</p>

<p><i>Arthur</i> from Iowa. You are right, my boy.
What is generally meant by “talking back” does
harm instead of good. The Bible says “a soft
answer turneth away wrath.” But the trouble
is, when people are saying things on purpose to
vex us it is very hard to think of anything
“soft” to say, or to be willing to say it if we
could think of it. The One who has promised
to “keep the door of our lips,” is the only
Source of real help.</p>

<p><i>Harry</i> from Ohio. Yes, indeed, a boy six
years old may have a badge. I am sorry you
did not tell us the name of the habit you were
going to get rid of; but so long as you know its
name, and are pledged against it, we will trust
you.</p>

<p><i>Virginia</i> from Louisiana. I hope you don’t
think we put the letters of our Blossoms into
the waste basket! I am always glad when I
receive a pledge against “teasing.” I think it
one of the most troublesome habits we have to
deal with. So easy to form, so ready to grow,
so hard to get rid of. Yet it can be conquered.</p>

<p><i>Fred</i> from Illinois. I once knew a beautiful
black-eyed boy who used to tell his mother he
saw seventy-two cats down in the back yard,
when he meant that he saw three. His mother
used to laugh, and think such stories were amusing,
so Eddie kept telling them, until, when he
was nine years old, people said of him: “You
cannot believe a word that boy says.” And yet
I don’t think Eddie meant to tell what was
false; he had simply formed a bad habit, and
let it grow. I am glad to receive your pledge.</p>

<p><i>May</i> from Georgia. Do you know the difference
between “firmness” and “stubbornness?”
The former we admire, and the latter
is unpleasant to everybody. I asked a little girl
the difference between the two, and she said,
“Firmness was sticking to a thing because it
was right, and you thought you ought; and obstinacy
was sticking to it anyhow, because you
wanted your own way, right or wrong.” Do
you accept her definition?</p>

<p><i>Edward Mason.</i> Now, my friend, you and
I are both in trouble. You have sent a letter,
asking for a badge, and giving your pledge, but
you have not told me where you lived, neither
town nor State! How can I get a badge to
you? I am hoping your bright eyes will see<span class="pagenum"><a name="editors_3" id="editors_3">[3]</a></span>
this printed letter, and that you will at once
let me hear from you again.</p>

<p><i>Bernie</i> from Missouri. If here isn’t another
Blossom who bites her poor little finger-nails!
How glad we are that she has resolved to stop
it, and I hope by this time succeeded. Did the
missing magazines reach you at last?</p>

<p><i>Ella</i> from Nebraska. Oh! these tempers. I
know all about them. It is astonishing how
small a thing will ruffle them. Yet I know a
lady of whom everybody says: “How lovely
she is. One never hears her speak an ungentle
word.”</p>

<p>And the lady told me herself that when she
was a young girl she used to fly into a passion
over the smallest things, and have to be locked
into her room for hours! So, you see, the
naughty tempers can be overcome.</p>

<p><i>May</i> from Conn. Thirty-seven mistakes in
my “queer letter!” I wonder if any of the
Pansies will find more than that number? I
am waiting to see. Your little poem gave me
so much amusement I think I must copy it for
all our family.</p>

<p><i>Harold</i> and <i>Laurence</i> from New Mexico.
Welcome to our Pansy Bed, my dear, brave
boys! How do I know you are brave? Because
people who own their faults and resolve to
conquer them, have a right to that title. Don’t
you know the Bible says: “He that ruleth his
spirit, is greater than he that taketh a city?”
Is that just the way it reads? I am quoting
from memory. Look it up, won’t you, and see
if I am exactly correct?</p>

<p>We would like to hear about the interesting
things in New Mexico.</p>

<p><i>Lizzie</i> from Illinois. Don’t get discouraged,
my dear girl, even when things will not go just
as you want them. Don’t you know the old
couplet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">
If at first you don’t succeed,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Try, try again.</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="unindent">It is a good motto to work by. If I were you,
I would, by all means, try a “P. S.” in the new
home. You may be able, through it, to do a
great deal of good.</p>

<p><i>Marion</i> from Conn. I hope our badge is
helping you. Jealous people manage to get a
great deal of unhappiness out of things which
were intended for their pleasure. It is wise to
get rid of that weed as fast as possible.</p>

<p><i>Minnie</i> from Conn. I am glad to hear from
you. Yes, it is hard to do right; but we have
one comfort: it is, after all, a great deal harder
to do wrong, because doing right grows easier
as the days go by, while doing wrong makes life
harder for us each day.</p>

<p><i>Ralph</i> from Ohio. “My boy,” said an old
gentleman, putting his hand on the head of a
little fellow, “here is something to remember:
other people may do your work, but no one
can ever do your duty for you.” The boy is a
man now, a grand one, and says he has always
tried to live by that sentence which the old gentleman
gave him. Your pledge made me think
of this.</p>

<p><i>Stella</i> from Nebraska. There are plenty of
weeds in our bed, my dear; you need not think
you are alone in that; but the beauty of it is,
we are all trying to get rid of them. “I always
count tardy obedience just the same as disobedience,”
said a stern-faced mother to me the
other day.</p>

<p>That seems rather hard, doesn’t it? I don’t
think that is quite the way; but tardy obedience
is a very disappointing kind. I know your
mother must be glad that you intend to give
no more of it.</p>

<p><i>Clarence</i> from —— The truth is, my boy, I
don’t really know where you are from. You
forgot the State.</p>

<p>You are right about the mistakes. And did
you correct them all without help? I should
agree with you about the rabbit. I think we are
often very cruel in trying to cage and make
pets of animals and birds who are used to freedom.</p>

<p><i>Mattie</i> from Tennessee. O, yes! I have been
in Florida. In fact, while I am writing, I sit at
this moment under an orange-tree in Orange
Co., answering your letter. As I read it, I
raise my voice and give Mr. Livingston, who
is in his study overhead, your message. He
is very glad to get it. It makes a minister’s
heart glad to have a young listener say that
he makes things plain, in the pulpit.</p>

<p>I hope you find your badge a reminder whenever
you are tempted not to do the next thing
promptly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="editors_4" id="editors_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Rufus</i> and <i>Mamie</i> from Massachusetts. So
glad to welcome these dear people to our garden!
I think often of Rufus’ pleasant face, and
of his tender care of Mamie. I wonder if that
little Blossom is becoming less timid? Flowers
often droop their heads, but the sweet, gentle
dews make them look up and smile. I think the
dew of gentleness will drop all around Mamie’s
life and give her courage. Thank the dear
mamma for her sweet, kind, strong words to
me. When we all get home, what a happy
time we shall have together.</p>

<p><i>George</i> from Indiana. Oh! these tempers.
I think I must have said that at least a dozen
times this morning. I find so many of my
Pansies tortured by that weed “anger.” If we
were not sure we could succeed, how discouraging
it would be! As it is, I rejoice over every
new name I write in our great pledge book.</p>

<p><i>Emma</i> from Dakota. I congratulate mamma.
I know by experience just how trying it is to
have to repeat the same direction several times
before it is obeyed. If you read the answers to
letters, you will notice how many of our Pansies
are at work in the same line. We will take
courage; the next men and women will be
stronger and better than we.</p>

<h3>EXTRACTS FROM PANSY LETTERS.</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Dear Pansy</span>:<br /></p>

<p>I am a little girl ten years old. I have taken
<span class="smcap">The Pansy</span> for two years, and like it ever so
much. I got some nice presents from the Publishers:
a knitting machine, two balls of yarn,
a box of Logomachy, and your picture. I think
Nettie Decker was splendid. And Grandma
Burton did tell such lovely stories! My grandma
went to Heaven just a little while ago. She
was eighty-four years old. Mamma thinks I am
making my letter too long, but I cannot tell you
all I want to in a little short letter. If you
would only come to Wells Island I would go
down there on purpose to see you; I think a
great many other Pansies would do the same.</p>

<p>I have many faults to overcome. One is, not
being up in time for breakfast; another is, not
doing things quickly; and, not putting things in
their places when I have done with them. My
two little brothers want badges. One will try
not to act cross when he can’t have things just
as he wants them, and one will try to remember
to take off his hat when he comes into the room.</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Dear Pansy</span>:</p>

<p>I really cannot think how to commence this
letter. Oh! I want to tell you that I found
thirty-seven misspelled words in the funny queer
piece about babies. I hope none of them are
mine. Once I made up some poetry; it is not
very good, but I will write it to you. Here it is:</p>

<p>I have taken your magazine for nearly two
years. I like it very much. Ever since I began
reading the letters, I have thought how I should
like to join your band. Now I am going to,
although I am afraid you will find me a weedy
Pansy. I mean to try and pull out every weed.
I have so many faults, I do not know which of
them I need to overcome the worst. One of
them is not to go right away when mamma calls,
but to wait till I forget it.</p>

<p>How I should like to hear from you real
often! But I know you have so many Pansies
to write to, I will try to be real patient. Mamma
likes to read <span class="smcap">The Pansy</span> as well as I do. We
are reading the New Testament together.
Every morning when I get up, I take a verse
from the Bible to live by, during the day. One
verse I try to live by, is: “For even Christ
pleased not himself.”</p>

<div class="adtitle3">THE NEW ROGERS’ SCROLL SAW. NO. 2.</div>

<p>Given for new subscriptions amounting to $8.00; or for new subscriptions amounting to $5.00 and $1.25 cash
extra; or for new subscriptions amounting to $3.00 and $2.00 cash additional.</p>

<p>This season we offer to our subscribers the New
Rogers’ Scroll Saw, which the manufacturers declare
to be the best cheap saw ever offered to the
public.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 316px;">
<a href="images/i-063-big.jpg"><img src="images/i-063.jpg" width="316" height="557" alt="Scroll-saw" /></a>
</div>

<p>The latest improvements on this Saw are Pratt’s
Rubber Positive Blower and a new Clamp for
holding the Saw Blades.</p>

<p>The entire framework is made from Iron, painted
and Japanned black, and ornamented with red and
gilt stripes.</p>

<p>All parts made to interchange.</p>

<p>1. The Bearings to the Arms are carefully sized
to bring them in perfect line. (This is a vital
point in the construction of any Jig Saw).</p>

<p>2. Each machine is provided with a Dust
Blower, which is a very great advantage.</p>

<p>3. Our machine has a jointed Stretcher Rod,
which allows the operator to throw the upper arm
out of the way when adjusting his work or saw.
This joint also permits the machine to work much
more freely than with a straight iron rod.</p>

<p>4. Our clamps have a hinged jaw which overcomes
the disagreeable raking overthrow of the
blade, which is unavoidable when the saws are
secured rigidly to the arms. Saw blades are not
nearly so liable to break when clamps have this
joint. Thus a large percentage of the expense of
running the saw is saved. Besides this the saw
runs much easier, the swing coming at the hinge instead
of bending the blade with each stroke of the
saw.</p>

<p>5. The Balance Wheel is 4¼ inches in diameter,
with a handsome spoke centre and Rim of
Solid Emery (No. 70), ⅝ x ¾ in the No. 2 Saw.</p>

<p>6. The attachment for Drilling is on the Right
Hand Side of the machine, which, for convenience,
is an obvious advantage.</p>

<p>7. No Pins are used in the construction of this machine, as we prefer the durability of nicely fitted screws

</div>
<p>We make a special offer of the famed Waterbury
Watch (including a nickel-plated chain and whistle
charm) as a special premium. We will give the watch
and chain to any subscriber sending us new subscriptions
to our magazines amounting to $5.00; or, for
new subscriptions amounting to $3.00 and $1.25 cash
additional.</p>

<p>The Waterbury Watch will be found a marvel of
simplicity, accuracy and cheapness.</p>

<p>Accurate, because it will run twenty-four hours, and
keep time equal to the better grade of watches.</p>

<p>Cheap, because it will wear for years, and is offered
at a price within the reach of everybody.</p>

<p>Remember, the Waterbury Watch is not a toy, but
a real watch, having less than one half the number of
parts to be found in any other going watch in the
world.</p>

<p>A Watch winding at the stem, and having a stop-work
which prevents its being damaged by over-winding.</p>

<p>A Watch strong and durable in all its parts, and
calculated to do good service for years.</p>

<p>For beauty, durability, accuracy, and economy the
Improved Waterbury Watch is superior to any medium
priced Silver watch on the market. Its reputation as
a reliable time-keeper is thoroughly established.</p>

<p>This is one of the most liberal premium offers we
have ever made, and our special reason for making it
is that we wish you to obtain the necessary subscriptions
from your own town or vicinity, and acquaint
the subscribers with your satisfaction with the watch.</p>

<p>Every watch is perfect before leaving the factory
and is tested a few days in our office before being
sent away.</p>

<p>The Waterbury Watch is now carried by tens of
thousands of boys and girls, men and women. Time
itself has proven it to be the equal of watches costing
many times its price.</p>

<p>Its cases are made from the new metal, Silverloid,
which in appearance and durability is equal to the
best Coin Silver. Each watch is packed in a nice
satin-lined case.</p>

<p>The price of the watch is $3.50. Postage, packing
and registry fee, 15 cents additional.</p>

<p>This is the best premium offer of a Spy Glass that
we have ever made. This Glass has Rosewood body,
and three draws. It is 15 inches in length when
drawn out, 6 inches when closed. The object-glass is
one inch in diameter. The power is 13 times.</p>

<p>How far can I see with this Spy Glass? The distance
at which an observer can see objects depends
upon two considerations: First, the power of the
instrument; and second, the condition of the atmosphere.
All that is needful is to multiply the distance
at which the unassisted eye can see objects clearly, by
the given power of the glass. For instance, the atmosphere
being clear and steady, this Spy Glass will enable
a person to make out an object one mile distant
with the same distinctness that he can see it at a distance
of 130 yards with the unassisted eye. It is an
excellent instrument. Price $2.50. Postage and
packing 12 cents extra.</p>

<p>This complete and powerful instrument has the essential parts and general design of a first-class
modern Microscope. It is simple in construction and of convenient design, and is well
adapted for teachers and students, as well as for family use, affording amusement and
instruction to young and old.</p>

<p>The stand is eight inches in height, with hinged joint, allowing it to be inclined to any angle
for convenience of observation. The base is of cast-iron, handsomely japanned, the compound
body of finely lacquered brass, with draw-tube, for increasing the power of the object-glasses.
The stage is of ample size, and is provided with spring clips for holding the object
whilst under observation; beneath is a concave mirror, conveniently jointed, for the illumination
of all transparent objects.</p>

<p>One great advantage consists of the rack and pinion adjustment for focus. It also has a
condensing lens for giving a better illumination to opaque objects. The dividing <i>Achromatic</i>
object-glass gives a range of powers from 75 to 290 diameters, (not <i>times</i>, which is <i>area</i>,
remember), with an improved quality of definition. Two prepared objects, two glass slips and
brass forceps accompany each instrument, and the whole is packed in a neat polished mahogany
case.</p>

<p>N. B. Any one desiring this Microscope for immediate use, or as a present, can forward
$12.00 and receive it, and afterwards make up a Premium Club for it, as above offered, deducting

<p>We have made special arrangements whereby we are able to offer this Gem among engines for a
very moderate amount. Every boy can have a great deal of pleasure and gain much practical information
as well.</p>


<p class="center"><b>Description of the Engine.</b></p>

<p>The engine is 8½ inches high and 4½ inches in diameter. It is <i>nickel-plated</i> in all its parts,
and each engine is packed in a wooden box.</p>


<p class="center"><b>Safety-Valve.</b></p>

<p>It is impossible for the boiler to explode as the Engine has a perfect-working Safety-valve.</p>


<p class="center"><b>Steam-Whistle.</b></p>

<p>You will notice the location of the Steam-whistle by referring to the cut. The valve by which
the whistle is operated is also shown.</p>


<p class="center"><b>The Throttle-Valve.</b></p>

<p>The Engine is started and stopped by means of the Throttle-valve. No other small engine has
this attractive and important feature.</p>


<p class="center"><b>The Steam-Exhaust.</b></p>

<p>All oscillating Engines exhaust at the ports. This Engine exhausts into the smoke-stack, and
thus the steam passes off into the air.</p>

<p>The Power of the Engine is sufficient for running toy machinery. So perfectly and so accurately is
this Engine made that the screw-nuts on the cylinder head, and the rivet-heads on the boiler and fire-box
are represented (see illustration of the Engine.) It is a Scientific Toy, nearer in appearance and
operation to a large Engine than any heretofore made. It is both amusing and instructive. It is safe
and easy to operate. It will run small Toys, and develop ingenuity. It is a simple and complete
machine which will practically illustrate to the youthful mind that wonderful power so constantly at
work on all sides in this age of Steam.</p>

<p>There are 41 pieces and over 400 operations in the manufacture of this Engine.</p>

<p>In this little Engine every means of safety has been provided, so that young beginners may take
their first lesson without incurring any risk. The fuel to be used must in all cases be Alcohol as the
lamp is not adapted for anything else.</p>

<p>Every Engine is Tested by running at the Factory. The price of the Engine is $1.35. Postage

<p>One new Study and Writing Desk given for new subscriptions amounting to $3.50.</p>

<a href="images/i-134-big.jpg"><img src="images/i-134.jpg" width="145" height="177" alt="desk" /></a>
</div>

<p>The inside of the Lid is covered with prepared silicate, thus forming
a perfect blackboard. This Desk is for family use. It is a convenient
addition to the furniture of a sitting-room. It can be used by any member
of the family for reading, writing and study purposes. It is the
right size to use with the ordinary house chair. The desk is made entirely
of hard wood (ash), trimmed with walnut, and the top is covered
with enameled leather giving a very finished look. It has a lock and
key, and inside the desk are different apartments for papers, books, etc.
Raise the lid and draw it forward to front of desk and you have an inclined
blackboard. The Desk is strong and well made. The brace-rod
is firmly screwed to the legs, which makes the desk very firm. We also
recommend this Desk for school purposes.</p>

<p>A gentleman in Pennsylvania having charge of a private school
ordered one desk as a sample, and on examination sent an order for six
more saying “they were just what he wanted.”</p>

<p>Height, at lowest point, 29 inches; width, 25 inches; depth, 19 inches.
The cut is a good representation of the shape, proportion and style of the desk. For convenience and economy
the legs and ornamental top are detached from the body of the desk in packing. By this arrangement, the
cost of transportation is made very reasonable. Price $2.00. Receiver to pay express charges.</p>

amounting to $2.00 and 60 cents cash additional.</p>


<p class='center'><b>Ladies, Make Your Own Stamping Patterns.</b></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">
<a href="images/i-141-big.jpg"><img src="images/i-141.jpg" width="250" height="152" alt="Pearl’s Perforating THE LITTLE WONDER Stamping OUTFIT PATENTED. NOV. 21st 1882." /></a>
</div>

<p>This Sewing Machine Attachment makes Perforated Stamping Patterns, from the most elaborate and intricate
designs, either original or those from Art Books. The design is placed over from 1 to 10 sheets of
Linen paper and passed through the machine. Perforated duplicates are thereby obtained, each of which
will stamp the design a hundred times. Designs may be taken from wall paper, cretonnes, carpets, laces, etc.</p>

<p>Patterns perforated in this way are superior
in every way to those made by the old method.
There is no rough side from which you are
obliged to stamp; being alike on both sides
one can stamp from either side. There is no
possibility of the patterns “filling up” and
thus becoming useless, for each perforation is
made by actually removing an atom of the
paper the size of the needle or punch used.
Different sized punches are furnished so that
the operator can choose a fine or a coarse line
as best suits his work.</p>

<p>By setting the machine with a short stitch so
the perforations come close together, beautiful
stencils can be cut from card-board, paper, etc.</p>

<p>The “Little Wonder” is applicable to transferring designs for Embroidery, Braiding, Quilting, Ornamental
Painting, Frescoing, Wood Carving, Fret-Sawing, and for instantly copying designs on the blackboard for
the use of teachers illustrating lessons in Botany, Geography, Natural History, etc., etc.</p>

<p>Accompanying each outfit are instructions, showing how to perforate, how to stamp on any material without
liquids (the simplest and most perfect method known) and how to set stamping on velvets and plush by
steam; various minor uses to which the “Little Wonder” is applicable are also fully noted.</p>

<p>The “Little Wonder” Perforator can be furnished for the following Machines <i>only</i>:</p>

<p>Light-Running Domestic, Wheeler and Wilson No. 8, Remington No. 3, White, Household, double or
single feed, Weed “New Hartford,” New Home, Singer, “New Family,” Singer Improved, Elias Howe,
and New Howe “G.” <i>In case you do not have one of the above machines, possibly your neighbor has, and
would allow you to use it in exchange for some patterns.</i></p>

<p>We cannot supply them for any other machines. <i>Name your machine with your order (and it must be one
of the above), or we cannot send it.</i></p>

<p>Pearl’s Perforating and Stamping Outfit consists of 1 Patent Perforating Attachment, 3 small, 3 medium
and 3 large Punches, 1 Box Pearl’s Perfect White Stamping Powder, 1 Box Blue Powder, 1 Improved Reversible

<p>Hollyer’s Steel Plate engraving
of “Longfellow in His
Library,” is an accurate representation
of the room which
Longfellow used from 1837 until
the time of his death, and it
will undoubtedly be accepted as
the favorite picture of the
“American Popular Poet;”
the likeness is good; the attitude
and expression happily betoken
a mind deeply occupied
in the task before him; and
everyone who admires and appreciates
the writings of the
great poet, will be pleased to
see the appointments of the
room in which he worked, together with a faithful portrait of him. The central figure is that of the Great
Poet. He is seated on the right of a circular table, strewn with his books and writing materials. Price $1.00.</p>

<p>A and C are the two covers separated.</p>

<p>A-cover shows the paper filed on the wires, and the back or flap (B) which forms the back of the book.</p>

<p>C-cover has a metal hinge or clamping-bar, perforated for the wires, with lugs to hold the wires when bent
down, and a pocket for the back to slide into.</p>

<p>D shows the complete book, made without the objectionable bulging back of other binders.</p>

<p>The back (B), when in the pocket, forms a complete book with one sheet or any thickness of paper placed
in the binder. The wires are toughened by a process, and will not break.</p>

<p>We are gratified at being able to call the attention of our subscribers to an Improved Binder that we know
will give entire satisfaction. It is made very strongly, of the best materials, and makes a handsome, finished-looking
volume whether filled with the full number of magazines required, or with but one or two copies.
The Binder is made in two sizes and two styles; one is adapted for <span class="smcap">Wide Awake</span> and one for <span class="smcap">The Pansy</span>.
The name of each magazine is stamped in gold on the covers. Any magazine that is of the same size as either
of the above may be bound, either permanently or for temporary preservation. For instance, <span class="smcap">Babyland</span> or
the <span class="smcap">C. Y. F. Journal</span> will fit <span class="smcap">Wide Awake</span> binder very well.</p>

<p>We can supply the binder for either magazine in full cloth, or in half Russia. An awl for punching holes
in the magazines accompanies each Binder.</p>

<p>The Binder for <span class="smcap">The Pansy</span> will contain a year’s numbers. The Binder for <span class="smcap">Wide Awake</span> will contain a
full volume (six numbers).</p>

<p>It is in all respects the most desirable
article of the kind. It is a light,
durable and perfect board. With it
one avoids the discomfort incident to
holding a heavy board. The peculiar
felting finish upon both sides, effectually
prevents the slipping of the
work from the board, also the slipping
of the board from the lap. It is
manufactured from a material specially
adapted to this purpose. It will neither warp nor crack, and with proper care will last a life-time. The
graduated scale entirely does away with the need of a yard-stick or tape-measure. The Checker-Board upon
one side will be found very convenient for persons interested in either of the games of checkers or chess.

<a href="images/i-154-big.jpg"><img src="images/i-154.jpg" width="213" height="133" alt="Sewing machine" /></a>

<p>The easiest and most economical process ever invented
for making Rag and Turkish Rugs, Ottoman
Covers, etc. Every lady has enough material in her
rag bag to make several handsome durable rugs. Any
cloth, old or new, yarns, carpet waste, etc., can be
used. Small pieces of Silk, too much worn for Patchwork,
make pretty stool or ottoman covers. The Pearl
Rug Maker is a set of Steel Forms and Tines, on which the material is wound, then sewed
through the centre to a cloth foundation—<i>with any sewing machine or by hand</i>—forming
loops, which are readily cut open, making a soft, close pile or tuft a half inch thick,
all on the upper side. Rags when used do not have to be sewed together. Small
pieces are cut in strips, on the bias. A handsome Rug 2 x 3 feet, with a border, can be
made in a day. Folks who have talked hard times for years must have an abundance
of old clothes. The Pearl Rug Maker is the only invention that will utilize them without
being obliged to go to further expense than a spool of thread. With the scraps
of cloth, odds and ends that accumulate in every home, you can make Rugs that will
adorn any parlor. If you do not have enough bright colored pieces in your rag bag,
you can color them at trivial expense. (See our Premium Offer of Diamond Dyes.)
With the Pearl Rug Maker many ladies make an entire carpet.</p>

<p>The Pearl Rug Maker is made of Bessemer Steel, silver finish, and is put up in a
handsome case, with explicit “Directions for making Rag and Tufted Rugs,” containing
14 illustrations, which will enable anyone to do the work. Price postpaid to any
address, only $1.00.</p>

<div class="adtitle3">DIAMOND DYES.</div>

<p>Four packages (your choice of colors) given for new subscriptions amounting to
50 cents.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 102px;">
<img src="images/i-156.jpg" width="102" height="104" alt="jewel" />
</div>

<p>Comparatively few persons are aware that many articles of personal and household
use may be so renewed that they can be regarded as almost as good as ever
for further service. By using these Dyes, colors that have become faded or dingy,
or unfashionable, can be renewed; or the article may be changed in color and appearance
so that they may again be made serviceable.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 178px;">
<a href="images/i-157-big.jpg"><img src="images/i-157.jpg" width="178" height="281" alt="Looks like lady reading ticker tape but it's a ribbon" /></a>
</div>

<p>Each Dye is complete in itself, requiring no
other articles to set the color. It is really for
most colors no more difficult to dye any article
a perfect color than to rinse or starch such an article, and the person
making the trial for the first time will be delighted with the result. They
are warranted to give complete satisfaction when directions are followed.
Now at a trifling expense it can be done
in any house, and any one can save many
dollars every year by the extra wear they
can get from garments that have been renewed
in this way. After a lady has once
felt the comfort of having a faded or dingy
dress or garment made as good as new by
these Dyes, she will not fail to use them
often for these purposes.</p>

</div>


<p class='center'>COLORING HOODS, SHAWLS, ETC.</p>

<p>These articles are used by every lady,
and are frequently made of white or very
light colored material, and as a consequence
very quickly become soiled or
faded. Then they are usually discarded or given away. Now there is nothing
easier than to color these articles, and thus make them as good as new.
Simply follow the directions and they will come out all right.</p>

<p>The Diamond Dyes are unequalled for coloring Dresses, Cloaks, Coats,
Wrappers and all garments; Shawls, Hoods, Scarfs, Yarn, Stockings, Carpet
Rags, Feathers, Grasses, and many other articles of similar nature.
Beautiful wood stains may be made from the Dyes.</p>

<p>List of colors: Yellow, Scarlet, Crimson, Magenta, Cardinal Red, Dark Green, Dark Wine, Plum, Black,
Eosine (Pink), Bismarck, Old Gold, Orange, Maroon, Seal Brown, Violet, Brown, Dark Brown, Navy Blue,
Dark Blue, Light Blue, Terra Cotta, Slate, Purple, Garnet, Olive Green, Drab Green. Cardinal, for cotton,
Blue, for cotton, Yellow, for cotton, Green, for cotton, Scarlet, for cotton.</p>

<p>The Diamond Dyes of most colors work well on cotton, but for the colors specially mentioned above it is
necessary to have Dyes specially prepared. In ordering, specify “for cotton,” if so desired. Price of Diamond
Dyes, 10 cts. per package.</p>
